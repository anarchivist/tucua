Although they have some thickness, paper, film, and cloth are examples of two-dimensional materials."

While no materials meet the ideal definition of 'archival', many archivists use the term informally to refer to media that can preserve information, when properly stored, for more than a century.  The use of 'archival' in commercial advertising to describe products suitable for materials and implying an infinite life span has made this use of the word nearly meaningless; some products so described would never be used by most archivists for such purposes.",

LOCKSS creates low-cost, persistent digital 'caches' of authoritative versions of http-delivered content.  The LOCKSS software enables institutions to locally collect, store, preserve, and archive authorized content thus safeguarding their community's access to that content.  The LOCKSS model enforces the publisher's access control systems and, for many publishers, does no harm to their business models. \n\n\u00b6  Accuracy and completeness of LOCKSS caches are assured through a peer-to-peer polling and reputation system (operated through LCAP, LOCKSS' communication protocol), which is both robust and secure. LOCKSS replicas cooperate to detect and repair preservation failures. LOCKSS is designed to run on inexpensive hardware and to require almost no technical administration.  The software has been under development since 1999 and is distributed as open source.\n\n  "

      "Metadata is commonly defined as \"data about data.\"  Metadata is frequently used to locate or manage information resources by abstracting or classifying those resources or by capturing information not inherent in the resource.  Typically metadata is organized into distinct categories and relies on conventions to establish the values for each category.  For example, administrative metadata may include the date and source of acquisition, disposal date, and disposal method.  Descriptive metadata may include information about the content and form of the materials.  Preservation metadata may record activities to protect or extend the life of the resource, such as reformatting.  Structural metadata may indicate the interrelationships between discrete information resources, such as page numbers.", 
      "In terms of archives, MARC format and EAD are standards for structuring descriptive metadata about collections.  Dublin Core is a standard for structuring metadata that is intended for describing web resources. ", 
      "In terms of information technology, metadata includes the documentation of data architecture, properties, and methods necessary to store, retrieve, and use the data in a meaningful manner.  To the extent that data is a record, it may also include administrative, descriptive, preservation, and structural information."

Americans were not interested in the landscape marked by man's presence but they regarded nature as a virgin territory, a landscape that had not been sullied by human kind, in which the hand of God, its creator, could be seen.

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(METS 2003) Maintaining a library of digital objects of necessity requires maintaining metadata about those objects. The metadata necessary for successful management and use of digital objects is both more extensive than and different from the metadata used for managing collections of printed works and other physical materials. While a library may record descriptive metadata regarding a book in its collection, the book will not dissolve into a series of unconnected pages if the library fails to record structural metadata regarding the book's organization, nor will scholars be unable to evaluate the book's worth if the library fails to note that the book was produced using a Ryobi offset press. The same cannot be said for a digital version of the same book. Without structural metadata, the page image or text files comprising the digital work are of little use, and without technical metadata regarding the digitization process, scholars may be unsure of how accurate a reflection of the original the digital version provides. For internal management purposes, a library must have access to appropriate technical metadata in order to periodically refresh and migrate the data, ensuring the durability of valuable resources.\n\n\u00b6  The Making of America II project (MOA2) attempted to address these issues in part by providing an encoding format for descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata for textual and image-based works. METS, a Digital Library Federation initiative, attempts to build upon the work of MOA2 and provide an XML document format for encoding metadata necessary for both management of digital library objects within a repository and exchange of such objects between repositories (or between repositories and their users). Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of Submission Information Package (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model.

Considering the application of FOIA exemption 7(c) to a rap sheet, the court held that where the subject of a rap sheet is a private citizen and the information is in the Government's control as a compilation, rather than as a record of what the Government is up to, the privacy interest in maintaining the rap sheet's 'practical obscurity' is always at its apex while the FOIA-based public interest in disclosure is at its nadir. Thus, as a categorical matter, rap sheets are excluded from disclosure by the exemption in such circumstances.  "

The curator, with a mandate to collect for aesthetic reasons, isolates the photographs from the context of creation and offers them up for, what Svetlana Alpers calls, 'attentive looking' and thereby transforms documents into art.

      "Invented by Louis Jacques Mand\u00e9 Daguerre in the late 1830s and announced publicly in 1839, daguerreotypes were the first practical photographic process.  They remained common until the popularization of the ambrotype in 1854.  The surface is highly reflective.  The image appears as a positive when viewed while reflecting a dark background and as a negative when reflecting a light background.  The image is monochromatic, although color may have been added by hand.  Unless special camera optics were used, the image is laterally reversed.  The surface is fragile and may be tarnished.  To protect the image, a daguerreotype is almost always mounted under glass with a paper seal around the edge; most daguerreotypes are mounted in a hinged case."

De facto standards often result when one vendor dominates a market, while prescribed standards develop in competitive environments where market participants realize that agreement upon a standard will benefit all of the participants. De facto standards incite little argument, because the market as a whole decides them. However, prescribed standards cause much consternation, because of the often contentious processes that lead to their establishment.  "

      "Although traditionally associated with books and magazines, publication includes motion pictures, websites, CD-ROMs, videotapes, sound recordings, and other document formats.  'Publication' connotes a work that is widely distributed, especially by a commercial publisher.  However, it also includes works of limited distribution, such as those issued by a vanity press.  Similarly, a single copy of a dissertation deposited as a public record in a library may be considered published because it is available (distributed) to the public.", 
      "Works of limited distribution that have the physical characteristic of a publications, such as a binding and title page, are described as quasi-publications or near-print documents.  The rise of on-demand printing using sophisticated desktop publishing software and high-quality printers is blurring the distinction between quasi-publications and publications.",

A signature also has some ceremonial significance, and can impart a sense of clarity and finality to a record or transaction.

The introduction of Encoded Archival Description as an electronic standard for displaying finding aids on the World Wide Web has not diminished the importance of bibliographic cataloging, especially in institutions with collections including archives, published material, and other formats.

First, 'authentic' is off-target when the sense is 'substantial'. . . . Second, 'authentic' is an awkward choice when the sense is 'sincere'. . . . The OED notes that late-18th-century theologians tried to differentiate the words, arguing that a book is 'authentic' if its content is accurate, and 'genuine' if it is correctly attributed to the writer.  The point, weak as it was to begin with, has been preserved in some later usage guides.  "

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(Rosenblatt 1998) The term 'moral rights' is a translation of the French term droit moral, and refers not to 'morals' as advocated by the religious right, but rather to the ability of authors to control the eventual fate of their works. An author is said to have the \"moral right\" to control her work. The concept of moral rights thus relies on the connection between an author and her creation. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational, rather than purely monetary, value of a work to its creator. . . . \n\n\u00b6  In the U.S., moral rights are primarily protected by VARA. Before VARA was passed, courts and commentators struggled to find moral rights in the \"derivative work\" provision of the Copyright Act, the laws of defamation, the rights of privacy and publicity, the doctrine of misappropriation, and especially the Lanham Act, which deals with trademarks and unfair competition.  Authors may seek moral rights protection from state moral rights laws and art preservation statutes in California and New York, whose provisions resemble those of VARA. Authors whose works are not covered by VARA and the state statutes may also seek moral rights-type protection from various other sources of law.  "

Sometimes cool storage (65\u00b0F to 40\u00b0F, 18\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C) is distinguished from cold storage (40\u00b0F to 0\u00b0F, 18\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C).  Because deterioration caused by chemical reactions is directly related to temperature (see Arrhenius function), keeping materials at a lower temperature can significantly slow the effects of aging. A number of standards include precise definitions of cold, based on the materials to be stored.  See, for example, ",

In cool storage, materials can be paged directly to a reading room without acclimatization.

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(Bantin 1998) The life cycle model for managing records, as articulated by Theodore Schellenberg and others, has been the prominent model for North American archivists and records managers since at least the 1960s. . . . This model portrays the life of a record as going through various stages or periods, much like a living organism. In stage one, the record is created, presumably for a legitimate reason and according to certain standards. In the second stage, the record goes through an active period when it has maximum primary value and is used or referred to frequently by the creating office and others involved in decision making. During this time the record is stored on-site in the active or current files of the creating office. At the end of stage two the record may be reviewed and determined to have no further value, at which point it is destroyed, or the record can enter stage three, where it is relegated to a semi-active status, which means it still has value, but is not needed for day-to-day decision making. Because the record need not be consulted regularly, it is often stored in a off-site storage center. At the end of stage three, another review occurs, at which point a determination is made to destroy or send the record to stage four, which is reserved for inactive records with long-term, indefinite, archival value. This small percentage of records (normally estimated at approximately five per cent of the total documentation) is sent to an archival repository, where specific activities are undertaken to preserve and describe the records.\n\n\u00b6 The life cycle model not only describes what will happen to a record, it also defines who will manage the record during each stage. During the creation and active periods, the record creators have primary responsibility for managing the record, although records managers may well be involved to various degrees. In the semi-active stage, it is the records manager who takes center stage and assumes major responsibility for managing the records. Finally, in the inactive stage, the archivist takes the lead in preserving, describing, and providing access to the archival record.  "

A record may have great intrinsic value without significant informational or evidential value; records with significant informational or evidential value may have little intrinsic value.

Enhancements made possible the production of catalog cards and a cumulative index to the Division's holdings, thus providing access as well as administrative control.  These modifications were based on the LC MARC II format (record structure, content, and coding) and were intended to be compatible with the MARC format for manuscripts.  "

By 1960 the nature of collecting itself had changed from a concentration on papers of remote vintage to an emphasis on those of recent origin.  The latter had many characteristics of public archives, because of their comparable extent, structure, and depth of documentation.  \u00b6  The historical manuscripts tradition is rooted in librarianship.

      "An archivist's work with records of enduring value may be at any stage in the records life cycle, from creation onward.  In the United States, archivists are typically associated with collections of inactive records.  However, the European tradition includes management of active records as well, which in the United States is often the responsibility of a separate records manager. In the United States, archivists may be called manuscript curators, especially if they are responsible for collecting and administering collections of historical records acquired from individuals, families, or other organizations.", 
      "In some organizations, an archivist may be responsible for management of active, inactive, and archival records.  In other organizations, an archivist may be responsible only for those records transferred to the archives.  In a large repository, a practicing archivist may specialize in only one or a few archival functions noted above.  A  teaching archivist may not be currently responsible for collections but is familiar with the theory and practice of archival functions."

The British practice, we believed, if applied in the National Archives, could lead sometimes to groupings too large for administrative convenience. We thought it better to divide the records of such large 'agencies' as departments into a number of separate record groups, usually reflecting the bureaus within departments and of 'convenient size' for administration.\n\n\u00b6  On the Continent the French term 'fonds d'archives' \u2013 meaning the body or stock of records of a record-creating unit \u2013 was widely known in archival literature and accepted as the basis of arrangement work. . . .  As applied in practice, the records of any subordinate office that kept records, no matter how small the office, were considered a 'fonds.'  This was going to the other extreme of 'convenient size,' and the 'record group' principle as defined in the National Archives united the records of subordinate offices under their superior offices, usually up to the bureau level.  Also the records of small though essentially independent satellite agencies were often included with the records of major agencies to which they were related.  "

Bush and filed as a Federal Records Act (and Freedom of Information Act) challenge. The PROFS tapes contained, among other things, electronic mail messages of Oliver North concerning the Iran-Contra affair, transmitted over the NSC's internal e-mail system. [Citing Armstrong v. Bush, 721 F. Supp. 343, 345 n.1 (D.D.C. 1989).] . . . On January 6, 1993, as amended on January 11, Judge Charles R. Richey issued an injunction against the EOP (including the NSC), holding that based on the characteristics of the proprietary e-mail systems in place within the EOP and NSC at the time, the defendants' written records policies directing that hard copies of e-mail messages be printed out as the sole means of preserving e-mail records was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the U.S. federal records laws. [Note: Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 810 F. Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1993).] This holding was affirmed on later appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. [Note: See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993). On January 15, 1993, the government's emergency motion for a partial stay of the district court's Order was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals, allowing EOP components to delete e-mail messages from their live operating systems, so long as all record information was preserved in identical form on backup tapes.

As archivists, should we simply welcome this popularization of the term 'archives' or should we be bothered by the prevalence of its frequent misuse?   Perhaps we should look only on the positive side and see that the growing recognition of the value and importance of documentation that [David] Gracy sought. On the other hand, there is in the popularized use of 'archives' a rather significant threat to the basic goals of the archival profession. Call it paranoia, but I always have the sense that when we see 'archive' used as a verb, or the word 'archives' used in a bastardized way to describe what is clearly a singular, idiosyncratic, and synthetic gathering of documents, we are being confronted with a challenge to our position as professional archivists.

The effect was to stop for twenty years the addition of any published work to the public domain.  As Roy Rosenzweig noted in a recent article in the Journal of American History, '[f]or historians, copyright protection has redlined . . . much twentieth-century history. . . .'  In response, a group of publishers and preservationists filed suit challenging the constitutionality of copyright term extension.  The suit, Eldred v. Ashcroft, argues that 'perpetual copyright on the installment plan' is in direct violation of the constitutional stipulation that the monopoly rights granted by copyright be for a limited term.  The suit has lost in the Federal Appeals court, and recently the plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to rule on the issue. \u00b6  A coalition of information organizations, including the Society of American Archivists, the Association of Research Libraries, the American Library Association, the Digital Futures Coalition, and others have filed an amicus brief with the Court asking that they hear the case.  The brief notes the irreparable harm done to historians and institutions that exploit the public domain when copyright term is excessive.  "

The point, weak as it was to begin with, has been preserved in some later usage guides.  "

They know it conflicts with the present and offers both intellectually and spiritually enriching perspectives on life.  In the other world, we see well-funded, slick, and often superficial presentations of the past that generally reflect a single harmonious, monolithic, and monocultural image, free from disturbing incidents or experiences that might engender the question of 'why.' \u00b6  The social appropriation of the past for commercial and political use is a complex phenomenon. One the one hand, it bolsters public interest in history and would seem beneficial to archives.  On the other hand, much of the mass market appeal of history seems to operate on a more superficial and sinister level.  There is a strong primary emphasis on the emotive appeal of the past; nostalgia and 'event experiences' are very much in contrast to documentary-based examinations of the past where the evidence can be removed and reexamined.

      "Printing-out papers were prevalent from the invention of photography through most of the 19th century.  A negative was sandwiched between glass and a sheet of printing-out paper in a frame, and the whole was then placed in the sun.  The light slowly changed the silver halide to metallic silver. The photographer could monitor the printing progress in reduced light by pulling the paper away from the negative; if more exposure was needed, the sandwich was returned to sunlight to continue printing.  After exposure, the prints were fixed to halt further development.  Printing-out papers produce images that are a purplish brown and were usually toned to a purple black. Unfixed printing-out paper, often used for portrait proof prints, are often rust-colored and show signs of silver mirroring.  Eastman Kodak marketed printing-out paper under the name Studio Proof, intended specifically for portrait proofs."

Such papers may be produced from cotton fibers, rags, esparto, jute, chemical wood pulps, or virtually any other fiber, with special precautions being taken during manufacture to eliminate any active acid that might be present in the paper pulp. However free of acid the paper may be immediately after manufacture, the presence of residual chlorine from bleaching operations, aluminum sulfate (alum) from sizing, or sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, may lead to the formation of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid unless the paper has been buffered with a substance capable of neutralizing acids.

      "Orthochromatic describes the spectral sensitivity of monochromatic (black-and-white) photographic materials, which are not sensitive to red light.  As a result, reds and oranges in the original appear much darker relative to blues and greens of equal brightness.  Early photographic materials, especially film and plates used in the camera, were orthochromatic.  Most  black-and-white photographic papers continue to use orthochromatic emulsions, allowing the materials to be handled in the darkroom under red light."

      "Many tests are based on the Arrhenius function, which predicts that materials age in a predictable manner relative to temperature.  By determining how long it takes for materials in an environment with an elevated temperature to reach a predetermined level of deterioration (brittleness, fading, signal loss), it is possible to project how long it will take materials at normal storage conditions to reach that level of deterioration.  Because the level of deterioration is set arbitrarily, the test has a subjective aspect that makes results open to dispute.  For example, the test may accurately predict the time it will take film to reach a predicted level of brittleness, but some individuals would find the film to be sufficiently pliable to remain useful."

The information may relate, in a general way, either to persons, or things, or phenomena. The term 'persons' may include either individuals or corporate bodies. The term 'things' may include places, buildings, physical objects, and material things. The term 'phenomena' relates to what happens to either persons or things \u2013 to conditions, problems, activities, programs, events, episodes, and the like.\n\n\u00b6  It should be emphasized that the distinction between evidential and informational values is made solely for purposes of discussion. The two types of values are not mutually exclusive.  "

If we think of admissibility as a question of disclosure or nondisclosure, it us usually easy to say whether or not an item of evidence has been admitted.  When we consider the question of permissible use, the concept seems much more complicated. In the first place, evidence may be 'admissible' for one purpose but not for another. . . .  In the second place, questions of the permissible use of evidence do not arise only at the time of disclosure to the trier of fact. The court may have to consider admissibility in deciding whether to give the jury a limiting instruction, whether or not an opponent's rebuttal evidence is relevant, and whether or not counsel can argue to the jury that the evidence proves a particular point.

Data that can be readily compiled into information, whether presented on the screen or printed on paper, is also a 'document' under Rule 34. [Note: Fed. R. Civ.

To combat the fear of misuse of data, governments have introduced legislation that, among other things, makes the following requirements of organizations that maintain personal records on computers: to declare and/or register the use for which the data is stored; to provide the data subject with a right of access to data concerning himself or herself on their computer; to maintain a prescribed minimum level of electronic and physical security in their computer installation; not to transmit personal data to any organization that does not have similar controls over misuse of data.

Another data warehousing pioneer, Richard Hackathorn, describes the data warehouse as a single image of the business reality [citing Lambert].\n\n\u00b6  Data warehouses are becoming an increasingly popular tool for the management of data. The most fundamental reason for this is, firstly, that executives need rapid, easy access to data for planning and control. Secondly, data have historically been stored in disparate systems, in multiple locations, which made a complete view of organizational data almost impossible [citing Laudon & Laudon].  "

Under such a policy, backup tapes and hard drives would not be governed by an inaccurate characterization of them as retention systems, but rather by a proper understanding of their role in providing for system reconstruction in the event of loss of functionality.\n\n[Note:] Unlike archival systems, which contemplate restoring data, in part or whole, to an existing, active system to be used along with other active data, backup systems are designed to completely restore active systems that have been lost or corrupted as the result of some disaster. Therefore, while data stored in offline archives may often be restored to the active system and searched, searching backup files often requires either taking active data off the system or 'cloning' the system.

Supposing for example that a Viceroy sends home to the Secretary of State in England an elephant with a suitable covering-note or label; or supposing, to take a more actual example, that the Government of a Colony presents to the First Commissioner of Works in London a two-hundred foot spar of Douglas Pine: the question may be imagined to arise: Is the spar 'annexed' to correspondence with the Government of British Columbia? Is the elephant attached to the label or the label to the elephant? \u00b6 The answer to those who would put this dilemma to us in the present connexion is that the Administration would be obliged in all such cases to solve the question of housing \u2013 to send the spar to Kew Gardens or the elephant to the Zoo \u2013 long before the label or letter comes into charge of the Archivist: the problem is an Administrative, not an Archive one.

As the technology came into common use, a screw-powered letter press was used in conjunction with a press book, a bound volume of blank, tissue paper pages.  A letter freshly written in special copying ink was placed on a dampened page while the rest of the pages were protected by oilcloths.  The book was then closed and the mechanical press screwed down tightly.  The pressure and moisture caused an impression of the letter to be retained on the underside of the tissue sheet.  This impression could then be read through the top of the thin paper. \u00b6 These letter presses were used by some individuals and businessmen in the first half of the nineteenth century, but they only came into general use in the second half of the century. \u00b6 A letter press reduced the labor cost, both by decreasing copying time and by allowing an office boy to do the copying once performed by a more expensive clerk.  As the same time, it eliminated the danger of miscopying.  Copies were now facsimiles of the letter sent, down to the signature.  "

Surviving documents on such paper show that it was watermarked with the belled cap of a court jester, a 'fool's cap,' and that watermark (still in use as part of the tradition of papermaking) is an evident source of the term.  But this paper was originally imported from Italy, and is attested in XVIII as Genoa foolscap.  In It. such a sheet was called un foglio capo, a chief (large) sheet.  If foglio is given an English plural as foglios capo, the resultant form is very close to foolscap, whereby one must conclude that the term derives from both the watermark and the Italian name.  "

      "In the vernacular, 'archives' is often used to refer to any collection of documents that are old or of historical interest, regardless of how they are organized; in this sense, the term is synonymous with permanent records.  That use is reflected by archives", 
      "Many archivists, especially those in the United States who are influenced by the thinking of Theodore Schellenberg, follow an inclusive definition of archives, which encompasses a wide variety of documents and records.  Schellenberg also distinguished between the primary and secondary value of the materials; only materials with secondary value, value beyond their original purpose, could be considered archival. For Schellenberg, archivists appraise records for transfer to the archives on the basis of their secondary, research, evidential, or informational value. ", 
      "Other archivists follow the writing of Hilary Jenkinson, who argues that archives are 'documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference.'  For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation.  Because Jenkinson emphasized that records are evidence of transactions, he did not recognize any collections of historical documents as archives, although he noted that collections of personal papers were of value to historians because they complemented archives. ", 
      "'Manuscript repository' is sometimes used instead of archives", 
      "Some United States archivists deprecate the use of the form 'archive' (without the final s) as a noun, but that form is common in other English-speaking countries.  However, the noun 'archive' is commonly used to describe collections of backup data in information technology literature."

The various types of flat files, in which documents were stored flat rather than folded, eliminated abstracting, reduced retrieval problems, and allowed unlimited expansion.  Forms of flat files ranged from bound volumes, simple imitations of the bound press book used for copies of outgoing correspondence, to rearrangable cabinet flat files, harbingers of the vertical filing systems that were to revolutionize storage and retrieval of documents.

Metadata includes descriptive summaries and high-level categorization of data and information. \u00b6  Knowledge is information that is organized, synthesized, or summarized to enhance comprehension, awareness, or understanding. That is, knowledge is a combination of data and an awareness of the context in which the data can be successfully applied. Although the concept of knowledge is roughly equivalent to that of metadata, unlike data, information, or metadata, knowledge implies a human \u2013 rather than a computer \u2013 host. \u00b6  Understanding is the possession of a clear and complete idea of the nature, significance, or explanation of something.

The notion of information, however, goes back to Ludwig Boltzmann (1896), who stated that the increase in information about a certain system is related to a reduction in the number of states of the system and therefore to an entropy decrease. This concept was later generalized by L\u00e9on Brillouin (1956), who defined information as negative entropy or negentropy.  "

The information content of any physical objects, or logical data, cannot be measured or discussed until it is known what range of possibilities existed before and after they were received. The information lies in the reduction in uncertainty resulting from the receipt of the objects or the data, and not in the size of complexity of the objects or data themselves. Questions of the form, function, and semantic import of data are only relevant to information inasmuch as they contribute to the reduction of uncertainty.  If an identical memorandum is received twice, it does not convey twice the information that its first occurrence conveyed: the second occurrence conveys no information at all, unless, by prior agreement, the number of occurrences is itself to be regarded as significant.

Of course, if no archival theory or practice could be allowed unless it was 'perfect,' we would have not theory or practice.  Ultimately, the question becomes whether appraisal based on [use analysis], granted its many imperfections, is better or worse than the proposed practical alternatives. The second is that its practicality and broad applicability depends upon a growing number of use studies. Because every repository serves a somewhat different clientele, has a different mandate from its resource allocators, and must deploy different resources, in an ideal world, every repository would do it own detailed use studies for every segment of its collections.  These could be as simple as the MHS call-slip analysis, as complex as a process of user interviews, or as intensive as a citation analysis.  The world not being ideal, most repositories will have to extrapolate from studies done by similar institutions regarding similar records.  The third is that this is not a Magic Bullet.  Utilitarian appraisal does not equal 'easy' appraisal.  Unless we abandon appraisal as an archival responsibility, we will never make appraisal easy because we can never make it scientific or mechanistic.  If it were otherwise, I am convinced, there would be absolutely no reason for archivists to exist.  But a utilitarian method will provide a better rigor and rationale for appraisal decisions.  "

In the legal sense an alleged signatory to a document is always able to repudiate a signature that has been attributed to him or her. The basis for a repudiation of a traditional signature may include: \nThe signature is a forgery; \nThe signature is not a forgery, but was obtained via\n  unconscionable conduct by a party to a transaction,  \n  fraud instigated by a third party, \n  undue influence exerted by a third party.  \n\n\u00b6 There appears to be a movement within the electronic commerce environment to take away these fundamental rights that exist within common law jurisdictions. The general rule of evidence is that if a person denies a particular signature then it falls upon the relying party to prove that the signature is truly that of the person denying it. It should be understood that the term 'deny' and the term 'repudiate' are synonymous and this position is supported by standard dictionary definitions. \n\n\u00b6  Furthermore, the common law trust mechanism established to overcome a false claim of non-repudiation is witnessing. Witnessing simply occurs at the time the signature is being affixed. That is, by having an independent adult witness the signing of a document reduces the ability of the signatory to successfully deny the signature as a forgery at a later date. It is always open for the signatory to deny the signature on other grounds such as those enumerated above.  [Citations omitted.]  "

Therefore, it's up to individual companies to determine what information qualifies as intellectual and knowledge-based assets. In general, however, intellectual and knowledge-based assets fall into one of two categories: explicit or tacit. Included among the former are assets such as patents, trademarks, business plans, marketing research and customer lists. As a general rule of thumb, explicit knowledge consists of anything that can be documented, archived and codified, often with the help of IT. Much harder to grasp is the concept of tacit knowledge, or the know-how contained in people's heads. The challenge inherent with tacit knowledge is figuring out how to recognize, generate, share and manage it. While IT in the form of e-mail, groupware, instant messaging and related technologies can help facilitate the dissemination of tacit knowledge, identifying tacit knowledge in the first place is a major hurdle for most organizations.

While it is the task of paleography to determine what type of script is proper to an era and an environment, it is the task of diplomatics to examine other characteristics of the script, such as the layout of the writing with respect to the physical form of the document, the presence of different hands or types of writing in the same document, the correspondence between paragraphs and conceptual sections of the text, type of punctuation, abbreviations, initialisms, ink, erasures, corrections, etc. With the invention of the printing press, and later, of the typewriter, some of these characteristics became irrelevant to the purpose of diplomatic criticism.  The need for careful examination of these characteristics is arising again, however, thanks to the advent of new technology.  Computer software, for example, may be considered as part of the extrinsic 'script,' because it determines the layout and articulation of the discourse, and can provide information about provenance, procedures, processes, uses, modes of transmission and, last but not least, authenticity.

Daniels-Howell] developed is based on the assumption that 'all archival appraisal is local and subjective', but that, through careful analysis of both records creators and the records themselves, archivists can establish appraisal and selection criteria that are 'rational and efficient relative to a specific repository's goals and resources'. The strategy they propose includes: defining a collecting area; analyzing existing collections; determining the documentary universe, including relevant government records, printed and other sources; prioritizing industrial sectors, individual businesses, geographic regions, and time periods from which records will be sought; defining functions performed by businesses and the collecting levels needed to document major functions; connecting documentary levels to priority tiers; and updating this process every three to seven years. They outline priority factors used in making these decisions, documentation levels, and decision points to refine the priority levels. This Minnesota Method combines features of archival approaches to collection analysis, documentation strategy, appraisal, and functional analysis.  "

The copyright laws of the United States grant certain rights to copyright owners for the protection of their works of authorship. Among these rights is the right to make, and to authorize others to make, a reproduction of the copyrighted work, and the right to distribute, and to authorize others to distribute, the copyrighted work. Both the reproduction right and the distribution right granted to a copyright owner inhere in all works of authorship and are, for the most part, exclusive rights. However, for copyright holders of nondramatic musical works, the exclusivity of the reproduction right and distribution right are limited by the compulsory license of section 115 of the Copyright Act. Often referred to as the 'mechanical license,' section 115 grants third parties a nonexclusive license to make and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. The license can be invoked once a nondramatic musical work embodied in a phonorecord is distributed 'to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner.' 17 U.S.C. 115(a)(1). Unless and until such an act occurs, the copyright owner's rights in the musical work remain exclusive, and the compulsory license does not apply. Once it does occur, the license permits anyone to make and distribute phonorecords of the musical work provided, of course, that they comply with all of the royalty and accounting requirements of section 115. It is important to note that the mechanical license only permits the making and distribution of phonorecords of a musical work, and does not permit the use of a sound recording created by someone else. The compulsory licensee must either assemble his own musicians, singers, recording engineers and equipment, or obtain permission from the copyright owner to use a preexisting sound recording. One who obtains permission to use another's sound recording is eligible to use the compulsory license for the musical composition that is performed on the sound recording. The mechanical license was the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law, having its origin in the 1909 Copyright Act. It operated successfully for many years, and it continued under the 1976 Copyright Act with only some technical modifications. However, in 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act ('Digital Performance Act'), Public Law 104-39, 109 Stat. 336, which amended sections 114 and 115 of the Copyright Act to take account of technological changes which were beginning to enable digital transmission of sound recordings. With respect to section 115, the Act expanded the scope of the mechanical license to include the right to distribute, or authorize the distribution of, a phonorecord by means of a digital transmission which constitutes a 'digital phonorecord delivery.' \n\n  "

A bibliographic description, such as that found in a MARC record, represents an individual published item, and thus is item-level. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the description and the item. The description is based on, and is derived from, the physical item. Archival description represents a fonds, a complex body of materials, frequently in more than one form or medium, sharing a common provenance. The description involves a complex hierarchical and progressive analysis. It begins by describing the whole, then proceeds to identify and describe sub-components of the whole, and sub-components of sub-components, and so on. Frequently, but by no means always, the description terminates with a description of individual items. The description emphasizes the intellectual structure and content of the material, rather than their physical characteristics.  "

Letters as a form of personal correspondence had of course existed for many centuries.  They were already used in commerce, mainly for external communication.  The conventions of letter writing were well established.  These included the date of writing, a formal salutation ('Dear . . . ') as well as a formal closing ('Your most . . .') . . . As the letter was increasingly used for internal communication, within and across departments, the new business experts, masters of efficiency, argued for a much simplified format.  Typing time could be saved if the company printed up letterheads with fields such as To, From, and Subject, and if openings and closings were stripped down to a bare minimum. . . . \u00b6 . . . The 'Subject' field had a double purpose.  It of course gave the recipient a quick way to determine what the memo was about.  But it was equally important as a resource for a new class of workers, the file clerk.  It helped the clerk determine where in the vertical files to store the memo.  "

Thus, no organisational view on data existed. These different data definitions also lead to inconsistent reports that cannot be used by management for decision making. In turn, the inconsistent reports cause users not to trust reports and organisational data. These problems were aggravated by the fact that data that went into the DSS systems were sometimes 'dirty' or inaccurate as there was no 'scrubbing' or cleansing process to ensure accurate data, presented in a uniform format. Lastly, data were shared reluctantly in business-unit-centric systems, and the data were not integrated, requiring complicated bridges to share data [citing Moss & Adelman 1999a]. The shortcomings of DSS systems became profound as the users of these systems changed from administrators at a tactical level to analysts and managers at the strategic level.  "

[citing Jean Favier] Those authoritative legal deeds which touch the lives of individuals and of organisations, and are indispensable to both, were already being preserved as far back as the 12th century. Notarial records2 are an extraordinarily rich source of information for all aspects of history, and nowadays are amongst the materials most consulted by researchers.  "

      "In principle, an item can be reformatted without any effect on its content.  For example, a nitrate negative can be reformatted by making a duplicate on safety film.  However, Marshall McLuhan's observation that \"The medium is the message\" is a reminder that physical characteristics influence meaning.  In the case of a reformatted photograph, some information embedded in the material nature of the original will be lost in the reproduction.  For example, a modern copy print of a 19th-century cabinet print will almost certainly use a different process, may not be the same size, and may not reproduce the back; the process, size, and date, which can help date the original, are missing from the reformatted copy.", 
      "Data files may be reformatted so that they can be read by different programs or to counter technological obsolescence.  For example, a document created in Word 5 must be reformatted before it can be read by Word XP or by any version of WordPerfect.  Or, home movies may be reformatted to DVDs.  Such reformatting may be imperfect, with a resulting loss of meaning."

      "The use of 'archivist' to describe a manuscript curator is common in the United States.  Some archives use the phrase to distinguish responsibilities for different types of materials.  For example, a manuscript curator is responsible for collections of textual documents, while a photograph curator is responsible for collections of photographs. 'Manuscript curator' is also used by some to distinguish individuals responsible for assembled or acquired collections, or for collections unconnected to the archives' parent organization.  'Manuscript curator' is sometimes related to the historical manuscripts tradition, which relied on techniques of curating materials based on principles of librarianship that emphasized item-level control rather than collection-level control."

These factors included not only the well known litany of pesticide misuse problems (resistance and non-target effects), but also the rapid development of technologies enabling more sophisticated approaches, primarily due to rapid advances in communication and computing, with the allied new sciences of operations research, systems analysis, and modeling.  \u00b6 \n\nAlthough much of the initial push for IPM came from California researchers in sympathetic response to Rachael Carson's Silent Spring, national acceptance of IPM as a philosophy and technology can be traced to 1970 to the first symposium of agricultural scientists brought together to discuss IPM in a conference held at North Carolina State University, which was jointly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, NSF, and USDA/CSRS.

(b) Record level deletion: Deletion on the record level occurs when a data structure, like a database table, contains multiple records; deletion at this level renders the record inaccessible to the database management system (DBMS) and usually marks the space occupied by the record as available for reuse by the DBMS, although in some cases the space is never reused until the database is compacted. Record level deletion is also characteristic of many e-mail systems. (c) Byte level deletion: Deletion at the byte level occurs when text or other information is deleted from the file content (such as the deletion of text from a word processing file); such deletion may render the deleted data inaccessible to the application intended to be used in processing the file, but may not actually remove the data from the file's content until a process such as compaction or rewriting of the file causes the deleted data to be overwritten.

Most often, incoming records are housed in modern office-quality folders and boxes that meet short-term rather than long-term retention requirements. \n\n\u00b6  With these points in mind, a holdings maintenance program has three major procedural objectives: \nto place documents into a good primary housing (a container that fully encloses them, supports them, and protects them from the environment); \nwithin the container, to group documents into folders for additional protection and support and to enhance safe access; \nto place documents that are severely damaged or vulnerable into individual enclosures. \n\n\u00b6  Also defined in a holdings maintenance program are the four functional, design, and compositional features of the housing supplies \u2013 the containers, folders, and sleeves \u2013 used during the course of work: \nhousings and enclosures must perform their assigned function; \nthey must be as simple and straightforward to use as possible to facilitate easy and safe access to the documents; \nthey must not contain any structural features that will physically damage or jeopardize the documents; \nthey must be made of stable materials that will not contribute to the deterioration of the documents in the present or the future.

These formulae constitute the final clauses, which can be divided into groups as follows: \n\u00b6 Clauses of injunction: those expressing the obligation of all those concerned to conform to the will of the authority. \n\u00b6 Clauses of prohibition: those expressing the prohibition to violate the enactment or oppose it. \n\u00b6 Clauses of derogation: those expressing the obligation to respect the enactment, notwithstanding other orders or decisions contrary to it, opposition, appeals or previous dispositions. \n\u00b6 Clauses of exception: those expressing situations, conditions or persons which would constitute an exception to the enactment. \n\u00b6 Clauses of obligation: those expressing the obligation of the parties to respect the act, for themselves and for their successors or descendants. \n\u00b6 Clauses of renunciation: those expressing a threat of punishment should the enactment be violated.  They comprise two categories: 1) spiritual sanctions, comprising threats of malediction or anathema; 2) penal sanctions, comprising the mention of specific penal consequences. \n\u00b6 Promissory clauses: those expressing the promise of a prize, usually of a spiritual nature, for those who respect the enactment. \n\u00b6 Clauses of corroboration: those enunciating the means used to validate the document and guarantee its authenticity.  The wording changes according to the time and place, but these clauses are usually formulaic and fixed.

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(W3C/IETF URI Planning 2001) There is some confusion in the web community over the partitioning of URI space, specifically, the relationship among the concepts of URL, URN, and URI. The confusion owes to the incompatibility between two different views of URI partitioning, which we call the 'classical' and 'contemporary' views.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6  1.1 Classical View\n\u00b6  During the early years of discussion of web identifiers (early to mid 90s), people assumed that an identifier type would be cast into one of two (or possibly more) classes. An identifier might specify the location of a resource (a URL) or its name (a URN) independent of location. Thus a URI was either a URL or a URN. There was discussion about generalizing this by addition of a discrete number of additional classes; for example, a URI might point to metadata rather than the resource itself, in which case the URI would be a URC (citation). URI space was thus viewed as partitioned into subspaces: URL and URN, and additional subspaces, to be defined. The only such additional space ever proposed was URC and there never was any buy-in; so without loss of generality it's reasonable to say that URI space was thought to be partitioned into two classes: URL and URN. Thus for example, 'http:' was a URL scheme, and 'isbn:' would (someday) be a URN scheme. Any new scheme would be cast into one or the other of these two classes.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6  1.2 Contemporary View\n\u00b6  Over time, the importance of this additional level of hierarchy seemed to lessen; the view became that an individual scheme does not need to be cast into one of a discrete set of URI types such as 'URL', 'URN', 'URC', etc. Web-identifier schemes are in general URI schemes; a given URI scheme may define subspaces. Thus 'http:' is a URI scheme. 'urn:' is also a URI scheme; it defines subspaces, called 'namespaces'. For example, the set of URNs of the form 'urn:isbn:n-nn-nnnnnn-n' is a URN namespace. ('isbn' is an URN namespace identifier. It is not a 'URN scheme' nor a 'URI scheme').\n\n\u00b6  Further according to the contemporary view, the term 'URL' does not refer to a formal partition of URI space; rather, URL is a useful but informal concept: a URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource via a representation of its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network 'location'), rather than by some other attributes it may have. Thus as we noted, 'http:' is a URI scheme. An http URI is a URL. The phrase 'URL scheme' is now used infrequently, usually to refer to some subclass of URI schemes which exclude URNs.  "

Multimedia documents, digital video and sound can also be digital records, but these remained outside the scope of this study.\n\n\u00b6  An important difference compared to paper records is the greater loss of information that can occur even while the records are being used, or afterwards when the records are being maintained. After all, hard discs and computers are replaced regularly and there are few barriers to destroying computer files.

        "quotation": "\n  \u2020(Barth 1997) [Beginning in 1964] LC developed two separate systems, the Master Record of Manuscript Collections (MRMC) to provide administrative control over holdings, and SPINDEX (emerging out of the previous punch card project) to provide automated forms of access to archival materials. The National Archives joined the automation effort in 1967, and developed a derivative system from SPINDEX geared more specifically for archival collections at NARA called SPINDEX II. \u00b6\n\nSPINDEX II focused on providing access to archival collections by automating previously prepared and published finding aids.   \u00b6\n\nThe National Archives used SPINDEX II extensively throughout the 1970s, producing among other guides, the first comprehensive index to the Papers of the Continental Congress in conjunction with the American Bicentennial. NARA also used the system to prepare up-to-date collection guides (subject-based, and format-based) as well as the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's Directory of Archives and Manuscript Repositories. NARA did make the SPINDEX II system available to other organizations, and the system was used widely both as an archival control program, but also in a records management capacity for many corporations in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\n\n  "

The index provides for a primary sort of keywords, alphabetically or chronologically, and a secondary sort by either title or date. . . . After the staff of the NHPRC decided to use SPINDEX in the creation of a national data base of information on archives and manuscripts in the United States, they requested that NARS make significant changes in the SPINDEX II software package. Carrying out these modifications resulted in the creation of SPINDEX III.  "

      "Stereographs were very common from the 1850s through the 1910s.  The earliest stereographs were made from daguerreotypes.  Most 19th-century stereographs were albumen prints on cards measuring 3\u215c \u00d7 7 inches, although stereographs were made using other formats.  Most 20th century stereographs used gelatin silver prints on cards the same size.  Stereographs are commonly viewed in a special viewer that displays the left image to the left eye and the right image to the right eye."

That is, if r1 and r2 are the (absolute) rates of deterioration of a specific paper under two sets of temperature and relative humidity conditions we shall not deal with r1 and r2 individually but only with their ratio r2/r1 which measures the relative change in the deterioration rate resulting from the change in environmental conditions.\n\n  "

While the normal practice of the NA is to acquire electronic records into our custody, some specified categories of electronic records will be 'left out' under the control of their creators, and indeed perhaps left there for a very long time. Ultimately, however, if the agency goes defunct, or no longer operates the system, or maintains records in it for any sort of operational use, the NA would assume custody.  "

Many archives arrange records only to the folder level, although some archives arrange the items within each folder.  Arrangement is often combined with the process of rehousing materials into archival containers and folders, and includes the labeling and shelving of materials. Though not widely practiced, arrangement can be employed in an intellectual sense, without a corresponding physical ordering of material.  For example, five folders stored in four different boxes can be listed together in a finding aid as an ordered series without changing their storage location. ", 
      "Arrangement with respect to original order presumes such an order is discernable.  Archivists are not required to preserve 'original chaos', and may arrange such materials in a way that facilitates their use and management without violation of any archival principle. ",

Archivists make the distinction between an archival fonds, where the items are of known provenance and their arrangement reflects their original working order as the records of an organisation or individual, and an 'artificial collection,' where the items are associated but lack the coherence of a fonds. The archivist recognises the fonds as the set of items that have been created and accumulated by an identifiable individual body (or bodies). However, it should be emphasised that both these classes of aggregates (the fonds and the artificial collection) are 'collections' in the more general sense in which the term is used here. Within an archival fonds, an item can be fully understood only within the context of its relationship with other items and aggregates in the fonds, and descriptive practice reflects this.  "

When a greasy ink is applied, the water-soaked areas resist the ink, and the greasy image areas accept the ink.  The design is then transferred to paper in a press.  The original printing surfaces were made from limestone.  Offset lithography using flexible metal plates is a modern variation of the process."

Functional preservation goes further: the file does change over time so that the material continues to be immediately usable in the same way it was originally while the digital formats (and the physical media) evolve over time. Some file formats can be functionally preserved using straightforward format migration (e.g. TIFF images or XML documents). Other formats are proprietary, or for other reasons are much harder to preserve functionally  "

In the 19th century, collodion was commonly used as a binder for negatives, prints, ambrotypes, and tintypes, and albumen was the most common binder for prints.

Ever since Paul Delaroche purportedly exclaimed, 'From today, painting is dead,' the photograph has been perceived as an objective record of reality, the product of a mechanical and therefore neutral means of documentation. . . .  Photographs derive the authority of their content from realism and accuracy, what J. B. Harley calls 'talismans' of authority; archival photographs convey their message through function and context. . . . The photograph is neither truth nor reality, but a representation willed into existence for a purpose and mediated by the persons concurring in its formation.  "

On the basis of this understanding, the project will formulate methodologies for ensuring that the records created using these systems can be trusted as to their content (that is, are reliable and accurate) and as records (that is, are authentic) while used by the creator; for selecting those that have to be kept for legal, administrative, social or cultural reasons after they are no longer needed by the creator; for preserving them in authentic form over the long term; and for analyzing and evaluating advanced technologies for the implementation of these methodologies in a way that respects cultural diversity and pluralism.

The life cycle model argues that there are clearly definable stages in record-keeping and creates a sharp distinction between current and historical record-keeping. The record continuum, on the other hand, has provided Australian records managers and archivists with a way of thinking about the integration of record-keeping and archiving processes.\n\n\u00b6  The life cycle model sees records passing through stages until they eventually 'die', except for the 'chosen ones' that are reincarnated as archives. A continuum-based approach suggests integrated time-space dimensions. Records are 'fixed' in time and space from the moment of their creation, but record-keeping regimes carry them forward and enable their use for multiple purposes by delivering them to people living in different times and spaces.

It brings the rigor of XML to Web pages and is the keystone in W3C's work to create standards that provide richer Web pages on an ever increasing range of browser platforms including cell phones, televisions, cars, wallet sized wireless communicators, kiosks, and desktops.\n\n\u00b6  XHTML 1.0 is the first step and the HTML Working Group is busy on the next. XHTML 1.0 reformulates HTML as an XML application. This makes it easier to process and easier to maintain. XHTML 1.0 borrows elements and attributes from W3C's earlier work on HTML 4, and can be interpreted by existing browsers, by following a few simple guidelines.  "

Such aspects, properties, or characteristics are called facets of a class or subject, a term introduced into classification theory and given this new meaning by the Indian librarian and classificationist S. R. Ranganathan and first used in his Colon Classification in the early 1930s.  Although the term was then new to classification, the idea was not (as Ranganathan freely admitted).  It had its roots in Dewey's device of place (location) as using a standard number (e.g., the United States always being 73) appended to any subject number by means of digits 09, a device now known as a facet indicator.

In the conservation science community, gaseous processes have traditionally been deemed to have a significant edge over liquid phase, solvent-based processes, mainly because they preclude any possibility of adverse effects on inks, dyes and colored pigments in manuscripts, color plates and book covers due to bleeding or softening of inks.

Anyone can use an individual's public key to encrypt a message that only the individual can decrypt using the private key. Public key cryptography was a breakthrough because it was the first technology that not require keys be exchanged in advance.  Two individuals, each with their own public and private keys, can send each other messages that are completely confidential.  Alice sends Bob messages using Bob's public key; only Bob has the key to decrypt and read her messages.  Bob sends Alice messages using Alice's public key; only Alice has the private key to read his messages.",

If Alice receives an encrypted message that can be read with Bob's public key and if she has confidence that the public key is Bob's, then she can have equal confidence that the message is from Bob.

But its mate, the key that actually performed the encryption, didn't have to be a secret at all. In fact, you wouldn't want it to be secret. You'd be happy to see it distributed far and wide.  "

Primary values are those reflecting the basic business purpose(s) served by the records, the reason they were created. Secondary values reflect other uses to which the information may be put during the course of their life cycle, uses that may justify continuing retention after the expiration of primary values. Administrative or operational values are usually identified as primary values. Research or historical values are generally designated as secondary values. Legal value can be either a primary or a secondary value, depending on the purpose and function of a record. A records series can (and usually does) possess several of these values simultaneously, and they may change during a record's life cycle.  "

The Johns Hopkins Variorum Edition of Edmund Spenser, for instance, includes notes not only by that edition's editors, but by dozens of earlier critics, going back to the eighteenth century: for any passage in Spenser, the reader can see what earlier commentators have had to say about it.\n\n\u00b6  Other variorum editions reproduce not critical commentary but textual variants and conjectural emendations proposed by many other editors. The Arden Shakespeare, for example, gives the readings in all the important early witnesses (the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century quartos and folios), and, when they're relevant, the readings proposed by editors from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.

The fonds is thus the conceptual 'whole' that reflects an organic process in which a records creator produces or accumulates series of records which themselves exhibit a natural unity based on shared function, activity, form or use.

A fonds is an organic whole and that any Administration, or one or more of its fonctionnaires, can create a fonds d'archives provided that these include r\u00e9solutions or proc\u00e8s-verbaux; the inclusion of archives of such a type making it autonome. Roughly speaking, we may take it that they would make the qualities of a fonds d'archives depend on its including those which, when the administration which created it was active, constituted the final authority for executive action. For our purposes we may do better perhaps to represent this quality in terms of Administration rather than terms of documents, the forms of which are not necessarily constant.  Fonds we may render, for lack of a better translation, Archive Group, and define this as the Archives resulting from the work of an Administration which was an organic whole, complete in itself, capable of dealing independently, without any added or external authority, with every side of any business which could normally be presented to it.  This, it may be said, is to make the Archive Group a division much wider, much less strictly defined that the Fonds.  "

Its branches provide archivists with a regional forum in all parts of the world (except North America); its sections bring together archivists and archival institutions interested in particular areas of professional interest; its committees and working groups are engaging the contribution of experts to the solution of specific problems. The ICA Secretariat serves the administrative needs of the organisation and maintains relations between members and cooperation with related bodies and other international organizations.\n\n\u00b6 ICA is the professional organisation for the world archival community, dedicated to promoting the preservation, development, and use of the world's archival heritage. \n\nIt brings together national archive administrations, professional associations of archivists, regional and local archives and archives of other organizations as well as individual archivists. \n\nICA has more than 1,500 members in over 170 countries and territories, making it truly international. \n\nIt is a non-governmental organisation, which means that it maintains an independence from the political process and that its members include public and private archive institutions and individuals. \n\nICA works closely with inter-governmental organizations such as UNESCO and the Council of Europe. It also has strong links with other non-governmental organizations.  "

Codd, father of the relational database, and his associates have produced a white paper listing the 12 rules for OLAP (on-line analytical processing) systems. The list is fundamentally a formula for a successful information system, whether you call it an EIS, a DSS, or a business information system. \u00b6  \n 1. Multidimensional conceptual view. This supports EIS 'slice-and-dice'\n    operations and is usually required in financial modeling. \u2013 \n 2. Transparency. OLAP systems should be part of an open system that\n    supports heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, the end user should\n    not have to be concerned about the details of data access or conversions. \u2013 \n 3. Accessibility. The OLAP should present the\n user with a single logical schema of the data.  \u2013 \n 4. Consistent reporting performance. Performance should not degrade\n    as the number of dimensions in the model increases.  \u2013 \n 5. Client/server architecture. Requirement for open, modular systems. \u2013 \n 6. Generic dimensionality. Not limited to 3-D and not biased toward\n    any particular dimension. A function applied to one dimension\n    should also be able to be applied to another. \u2013 \n 7. Dynamic sparse-matrix handling. Related both to the idea of nulls\n    in relational databases and to the notion of compressing large files,\n    a sparse matrix is one in which not every cell contains data. OLAP\n    systems should accommodate varying storage and data-handling options. \u2013 \n 8. Multiuser support. OLAP systems, like EISes, need to support\n    multiple concurrent users, including their individual views or\n    slices of a common database. \u2013 \n 9. Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations. Similar to rule 6; all\n    dimensions are created equal, and operations across data dimensions\n    do not restrict relationships between cells. \u2013 \n10. Intuitive data manipulation. Ideally, users shouldn't have to use\n    menus or perform complex multiple-step operations when an intuitive\n    drag-and-drop action will do. \u2013 \n11. Flexible reporting. Save a tree. Users should be able to print just\n    what they need, and any changes to the underlying financial model\n    should be automatically reflected in reports. \u2013 \n12. Unlimited dimensional and aggregation levels. A serious tool\n    should support at least 15, and preferably 20, dimensions.  "

Nevertheless, ISO occupies a special position between the public and private sectors. This is because, on the one hand, many of its member institutes are part of the governmental structure of their countries, or are mandated by their government. On the other hand, other members have their roots uniquely in the private sector, having been set up by national partnerships of industry associations. \n\n\u00b6 Therefore, ISO is able to act as a bridging organization in which a consensus can be reached on solutions that meet both the requirements of business and the broader needs of society, such as the needs of stakeholder groups like consumers and users.

It is particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource. However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can also be used to represent information about things that can be identified on the Web, even when they cannot be directly retrieved on the Web. Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.\n\n\u00b6  RDF is intended for situations in which this information needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning.  "

The use of the general term 'record' when referring to a particular type of record inevitably leads to confusion because attributes of the particular type are not conveyed by the general term. In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations.  The general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301, cited below), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC \u00a7 552(a), cited below).

The Web trivialized this original Xanadu model, vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking one-way links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use.  Fonts and glitz, rather than content connective structure, prevail. \n\n\u00b6 Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations. \n\n\u00b6 Xanalogical literary structure is a unique symmetrical connective system for text (and other separable media elements), with two complementary forms of connection that achieve these functions \u2013 survivable deep linkage (content links) and recognizable, visible re-use (transclusion).

Some cases take the view that material gathered by way of preliminary investigation does not become a public record before some official action of approval or disapproval.  On the other hand, the drawing of a distinction between writings representing tentative action and those memorializing ultimate action has been regarded as objectionable, not only because it is inconsistent with the principle which underlies the statutes making public writings freely available for inspection, but also because it provides a device by which a public official can hinder a citizen's legitimate attempt to obtain writings which are clearly within the strictest definition of a public record.
