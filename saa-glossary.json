      "ANSI/AIIM deprecates the use of 'archival' because it is a highly subjective term.  Rather, they suggest using measures of 'life expectancy', which are based on empirical tests.  While no materials meet the ideal definition of 'archival', many archivists use the term informally to refer to media that can preserve information, when properly stored, for more than a century.  The use of 'archival' in commercial advertising to describe products suitable for materials and implying an infinite life span has made this use of the word nearly meaningless; some products so described would never be used by most archivists for such purposes.", 
      "When archivists need to specify media appropriate for records of enduring value or containers for the storage of such materials, they avoid the term 'archival' and use specific requirements such as 'lignin free' or 'acid free with a three percent calcium carbonate reserve.'"

Typically metadata is organized into distinct categories and relies on conventions to establish the values for each category.

Descriptive metadata may include information about the content and form of the materials.

Structural metadata may indicate the interrelationships between discrete information resources, such as page numbers.\r\n\r\n",

      "These utilities grew out of cooperative cataloging projects in libraries, allowing one library to catalog a book and other libraries to use that record in their catalog.  The utilities were able to exploit the information in the database to provide interlibrary loan services to member libraries and to provide subscribers the ability to search for works across many libraries' holdings.  One factor motivating archives' use of the MARC format was to enable descriptions of archival collections to be entered, searched, and retrieved  in these utilities alongside related materials from other repositories.  Two prominent utilities are OCLC and RLIN."

The pejorative tone attached to the term 'curator' usually derives from the erroneous assumption that a photo-archivist is motivated by the same concerns as the curator, namely artistic merit or connoisseurship. . . . The curator, with a mandate to collect for aesthetic reasons, isolates the photographs from the context of creation and offers them up for, what Svetlana Alpers calls, 'attentive looking' and thereby transforms documents into art.

      "Invented by Louis Jacques Mand\u00e9 Daguerre in the late 1830s and announced publicly in 1839, daguerreotypes were the first practical photographic process.  They remained common until the popularization of the ambrotype in 1854.  The surface is highly reflective.  The image appears as a positive when viewed while reflecting a dark background and as a negative when reflecting a light background.  The image is monochromatic, although color may have been added by hand.  Unless special camera optics were used, the image is laterally reversed.  The surface is fragile and may be tarnished.  To protect the image, a daguerreotype is almost always mounted under glass with a paper seal around the edge; most daguerreotypes are mounted in a hinged case."

However, the processes that interested parties follow to establish standards can differ dramatically. Standards can either be de facto (occurring as a result of natural market movement and adoption) or prescribed (established by formal agreement). De facto standards often result when one vendor dominates a market, while prescribed standards develop in competitive environments where market participants realize that agreement upon a standard will benefit all of the participants. De facto standards incite little argument, because the market as a whole decides them. However, prescribed standards cause much consternation, because of the often contentious processes that lead to their establishment."

      "Although traditionally associated with books and magazines, publication includes motion pictures, websites, CD-ROMs, videotapes, sound recordings, and other document formats.  'Publication' connotes a work that is widely distributed, especially by a commercial publisher.  However, it also includes works of limited distribution, such as those issued by a vanity press.  Similarly, a single copy of a dissertation deposited as a public record in a library may be considered published because it is available (distributed) to the public.\r\n\r\n", 
      "Works of limited distribution that have the physical characteristic of a publications, such as a binding and title page, are described as quasi-publications or near-print documents.  The rise of on-demand printing using sophisticated desktop publishing software and high-quality printers is blurring the distinction between quasi-publications and publications.\r\n\r\n", 
      "Publication has a preservation function by increasing the chances that at least one copy will be preserved if other copies are damaged or destroyed."

This adaptation has become increasingly common in recent years, as the special MARC AMC format was eliminated in favor of a single bibliographic format for MARC records that describes all formats of materials and the underlying and unifying principles that can be used to describe both published and unpublished materials.  The introduction of Encoded Archival Description as an electronic standard for displaying finding aids on the World Wide Web has not diminished the importance of bibliographic cataloging, especially in institutions with collections including archives, published material, and other formats.

Both forms of automatic indexing created ordered lists of concepts that could be browsed, with pointers to the place where those concepts would appear in the text.  Full-text search engines, such as those that index the web, create links between terms or phrases and the documents but generally do not produce a browsable list of headings."

An author is said to have the \"moral right\" to control her work. The concept of moral rights thus relies on the connection between an author and her creation. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational, rather than purely monetary, value of a work to its creator. . . . \r\n\r\n\u00b6  In the U.S., moral rights are primarily protected by VARA. Before VARA was passed, courts and commentators struggled to find moral rights in the \"derivative work\" provision of the Copyright Act, the laws of defamation, the rights of privacy and publicity, the doctrine of misappropriation, and especially the Lanham Act, which deals with trademarks and unfair competition.  Authors may seek moral rights protection from state moral rights laws and art preservation statutes in California and New York, whose provisions resemble those of VARA. Authors whose works are not covered by VARA and the state statutes may also seek moral rights-type protection from various other sources of law."

The special signs can be divided into two categories: the signs of the writer and the subscribers, and the signs of the chancery or the records office. The first category includes the symbols used by notaries as personal marks in the medieval period, corresponding to the modern notarial stamp, and the crosses used by some subscribers in place of their name.  The second category includes the rota and bene valete used by the paper chancery; the monogram of the sovereign's personal name used in imperial and royal chanceries; the initials m.p.r. for manu proprio; the double s for s(ub) scripsi; and all the various office stamps."

        "quotation": "\u008620\u00a0(Bantin 1998): The life cycle model for managing records, as articulated by Theodore Schellenberg and others, has been the prominent model for North American archivists and records managers since at least the 1960s. . . . This model portrays the life of a record as going through various stages or periods, much like a living organism. In stage one, the record is created, presumably for a legitimate reason and according to certain standards. In the second stage, the record goes through an active period when it has maximum primary value and is used or referred to frequently by the creating office and others involved in decision making. During this time the record is stored on-site in the active or current files of the creating office. At the end of stage two the record may be reviewed and determined to have no further value, at which point it is destroyed, or the record can enter stage three, where it is relegated to a semi-active status, which means it still has value, but is not needed for day-to-day decision making. Because the record need not be consulted regularly, it is often stored in a off-site storage center. At the end of stage three, another review occurs, at which point a determination is made to destroy or send the record to stage four, which is reserved for inactive records with long-term, indefinite, archival value. This small percentage of records (normally estimated at approximately five per cent of the total documentation) is sent to an archival repository, where specific activities are undertaken to preserve and describe the records.\r\n\r\n\u00b6 The life cycle model not only describes what will happen to a record, it also defines who will manage the record during each stage. During the creation and active periods, the record creators have primary responsibility for managing the record, although records managers may well be involved to various degrees. In the semi-active stage, it is the records manager who takes center stage and assumes major responsibility for managing the records. Finally, in the inactive stage, the archivist takes the lead in preserving, describing, and providing access to the archival record."

They argued that archivists should change their focus, from the content of a record to its context; from the record itself to the function of the records; from an archival role in custodial preservation and access to a nonarchival role of intervening in the records creations process and managing the behavior of creators."

      "An archivist's work with records of enduring value may be at any stage in the records life cycle, from creation onward.  In the United States, archivists are typically associated with collections of inactive records.  However, the European tradition includes management of active records as well, which in the United States is often the responsibility of a separate records manager. In the United States, archivists may be called manuscript curators, especially if they are responsible for collecting and administering collections of historical records acquired from individuals, families, or other organizations.\r\n\r\n", 
      "In some organizations, an archivist may be responsible for management of active, inactive, and archival records.  In other organizations, an archivist may be responsible only for those records transferred to the archives.  In a large repository, a practicing archivist may specialize in only one or a few archival functions noted above.  A  teaching archivist may not be currently responsible for collections but is familiar with the theory and practice of archival functions."

By this term I do not refer to the value that inhere in public records because of any special quality of merit they have a documentary evidence. I do not refer, in the sense of English archivists Sir Hilary Jenkinson, to the sanctity of the evidence in archives that is derived from 'unbroken custody,' or from the way they came into the hands of the archivist.  I refer rather, and quite arbitrarily, to the value that depends on the character and importance of the matter evidenced, i.e., the origin and the substantive programs of the agency that produced the records. The quality of the evidence per se is thus not the issue here, but the character of the matter evidenced."

The British practice, we believed, if applied in the National Archives, could lead sometimes to groupings too large for administrative convenience. We thought it better to divide the records of such large 'agencies' as departments into a number of separate record groups, usually reflecting the bureaus within departments and of 'convenient size' for administration.\r\n\r\n\u00b6  On the Continent the French term 'fonds d'archives' \u0096 meaning the body or stock of records of a record-creating unit \u0096 was widely known in archival literature and accepted as the basis of arrangement work. . . .  As applied in practice, the records of any subordinate office that kept records, no matter how small the office, were considered a 'fonds.'  This was going to the other extreme of 'convenient size,' and the 'record group' principle as defined in the National Archives united the records of subordinate offices under their superior offices, usually up to the bureau level.  Also the records of small though essentially independent satellite agencies were often included with the records of major agencies to which they were related."

Bush and filed as a Federal Records Act (and Freedom of Information Act) challenge. The PROFS tapes contained, among other things, electronic mail messages of Oliver North concerning the Iran-Contra affair, transmitted over the NSC's internal e-mail system. [Citing Armstrong v. Bush, 721 F. Supp. 343, 345 n.1 (D.D.C. 1989).] . . . On January 6, 1993, as amended on January 11, Judge Charles R. Richey issued an injunction against the EOP (including the NSC), holding that based on the characteristics of the proprietary e-mail systems in place within the EOP and NSC at the time, the defendants' written records policies directing that hard copies of e-mail messages be printed out as the sole means of preserving e-mail records was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the U.S. federal records laws. [Note: Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 810 F. Supp. 335 (D.D.C. 1993).] This holding was affirmed on later appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. [Note: See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1993). On January 15, 1993, the government's emergency motion for a partial stay of the district court's Order was granted by the U.S. Court of Appeals, allowing EOP components to delete e-mail messages from their live operating systems, so long as all record information was preserved in identical form on backup tapes.

As archivists, should we simply welcome this popularization of the term 'archives' or should we be bothered by the prevalence of its frequent misuse?   Perhaps we should look only on the positive side and see that the growing recognition of the value and importance of documentation that [David] Gracy sought. On the other hand, there is in the popularized use of 'archives' a rather significant threat to the basic goals of the archival profession. Call it paranoia, but I always have the sense that when we see 'archive' used as a verb, or the word 'archives' used in a bastardized way to describe what is clearly a singular, idiosyncratic, and synthetic gathering of documents, we are being confronted with a challenge to our position as professional archivists."

For example, the fully burdened cost of an electronic recordkeeping system may include maintenance contracts or support, staff training, and time necessary to ensure that the system conforms to appropriate recordkeeping requirements.  Similarly, benefit analysis considers more than immediate direct savings by monetizing intangible benefits.  For electronic recordkeeping systems, direct savings may include salary savings over the life of the project as a result of increased efficiency, as well as increased functionality and improved customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n",

For example, when a political campaign has run its course, when there is a satisfactory settlement of a will in a probate court, or when the seven years of risk of an IRS audit have passed, the primary value of the records ends.

      "Authenticity is closely associated with the creator (or creators) of a record.  First and foremost, an authentic record must have been created by the individual represented as the creator.  The presence of a signature serves as a fundamental test for authenticity; the signature identifies the creator and establishes the relationship between the creator and the record.  \r\n\r\n", 
      "Authenticity can be verified by testing physical and formal characteristics of a record.  The ink used to write a document must be contemporaneous with the document's purported date.

They know it conflicts with the present and offers both intellectually and spiritually enriching perspectives on life.  In the other world, we see well-funded, slick, and often superficial presentations of the past that generally reflect a single harmonious, monolithic, and monocultural image, free from disturbing incidents or experiences that might engender the question of 'why.' \u00b6  The social appropriation of the past for commercial and political use is a complex phenomenon. One the one hand, it bolsters public interest in history and would seem beneficial to archives.  On the other hand, much of the mass market appeal of history seems to operate on a more superficial and sinister level.  There is a strong primary emphasis on the emotive appeal of the past; nostalgia and 'event experiences' are very much in contrast to documentary-based examinations of the past where the evidence can be removed and reexamined."

For others, a standard is open only if a vendor-neutral third-party organization (or even governmental body) creates and manages it.

In an extended application of these terms, records contain whatever is to be remembered at ever so distant a period; registers, that which is to serve present purposes; archives, that in which any things are stored."

      "Printing-out papers were prevalent from the invention of photography through most of the 19th century.  A negative was sandwiched between glass and a sheet of printing-out paper in a frame, and the whole was then placed in the sun.  The light slowly changed the silver halide to metallic silver. The photographer could monitor the printing progress in reduced light by pulling the paper away from the negative; if more exposure was needed, the sandwich was returned to sunlight to continue printing.  After exposure, the prints were fixed to halt further development.  Printing-out papers produce images that are a purplish brown and were usually toned to a purple black. Unfixed printing-out paper, often used for portrait proof prints, are often rust-colored and show signs of silver mirroring.  Eastman Kodak marketed printing-out paper under the name Studio Proof, intended specifically for portrait proofs."

      "Many tests are based on the Arrhenius function, which predicts that materials age in a predictable manner relative to temperature.  By determining how long it takes for materials in an environment with an elevated temperature to reach a predetermined level of deterioration (brittleness, fading, signal loss), it is possible to project how long it will take materials at normal storage conditions to reach that level of deterioration.  Because the level of deterioration is set arbitrarily, the test has a subjective aspect that makes results open to dispute.  For example, the test may accurately predict the time it will take film to reach a predicted level of brittleness, but some individuals would find the film to be sufficiently pliable to remain useful."

Early carbon inks, which merely lay on the surface of the parchment, could be removed more or less completely simply by sponging, but the later iron gall inks were much more difficult to remove because of the interaction with the fibers of the tannin present in the ink. They had to be scraped and then treated with a weak acid, such as the citric acid of an orange. Even then traces of the original writing remained. Wetting the parchment in this manner softened it to such an extent that it was necessary to treat the skin with dry lime to make it dry and white once again. The word 'palimpsest' derives from the Greek roots meaning 'rub away again.' Also called 'rescript.'"

      "Woodburytypes and carbon prints are examples of relief images.  The denser areas of the image are formed by thicker layers of pigment; highlights are formed in areas with little or no pigment, allowing the support to show through.  Although three-dimensional, the depth of a relief image is negligible, and the relief is often visible only when the print is viewed with raking light. For sculpture on a surface with a noticeable relief use 'bas relief'.  For designs cut or carved into a surface, use 'intaglio'."

      "Like records, documents are traditionally understood to have content, context, and structure. However, the nature of those attributes may change in electronic documents. Electronic formats can present information in complex layers that are three-dimensional or have a nonlinear structure.  The phrase 'four-corners document' is sometimes used to distinguish an electronic document that can be printed on paper without loss of information from more complex, three dimensional documents.  Similarly, some electronic document content is not fixed, but may change over time; for example, a word processing document that pulls data from a constantly changing database.  These documents are described as dynamic documents to distinguish them from traditional, fixed documents   \r\n\r\n",

Another data warehousing pioneer, Richard Hackathorn, describes the data warehouse as a single image of the business reality [citing Lambert].\r\n\r\n\u00b6  Data warehouses are becoming an increasingly popular tool for the management of data. The most fundamental reason for this is, firstly, that executives need rapid, easy access to data for planning and control. Secondly, data have historically been stored in disparate systems, in multiple locations, which made a complete view of organizational data almost impossible [citing Laudon & Laudon]."

Its particular difficulty may perhaps be illustrated by a reductio ad absurdum. Supposing for example that a Viceroy sends home to the Secretary of State in England an elephant with a suitable covering-note or label; or supposing, to take a more actual example, that the Government of a Colony presents to the First Commissioner of Works in London a two-hundred foot spar of Douglas Pine: the question may be imagined to arise: Is the spar 'annexed' to correspondence with the Government of British Columbia? Is the elephant attached to the label or the label to the elephant? \u00b6 The answer to those who would put this dilemma to us in the present connexion is that the Administration would be obliged in all such cases to solve the question of housing \u0096 to send the spar to Kew Gardens or the elephant to the Zoo \u0096 long before the label or letter comes into charge of the Archivist: the problem is an Administrative, not an Archive one."

As the technology came into common use, a screw-powered letter press was used in conjunction with a press book, a bound volume of blank, tissue paper pages.  A letter freshly written in special copying ink was placed on a dampened page while the rest of the pages were protected by oilcloths.  The book was then closed and the mechanical press screwed down tightly.  The pressure and moisture caused an impression of the letter to be retained on the underside of the tissue sheet.  This impression could then be read through the top of the thin paper. \u00b6 These letter presses were used by some individuals and businessmen in the first half of the nineteenth century, but they only came into general use in the second half of the century. \u00b6 A letter press reduced the labor cost, both by decreasing copying time and by allowing an office boy to do the copying once performed by a more expensive clerk.  As the same time, it eliminated the danger of miscopying.  Copies were now facsimiles of the letter sent, down to the signature."

Surviving documents on such paper show that it was watermarked with the belled cap of a court jester, a 'fool's cap,' and that watermark (still in use as part of the tradition of papermaking) is an evident source of the term.  But this paper was originally imported from Italy, and is attested in XVIII as Genoa foolscap.  In It. such a sheet was called un foglio capo, a chief (large) sheet.  If foglio is given an English plural as foglios capo, the resultant form is very close to foolscap, whereby one must conclude that the term derives from both the watermark and the Italian name."

We appreciate the entertainment value of the past, but we care more about the educational value of the past.  And we understand that the greatest educational value comes from archives not as a source for images of the past but as the font of evidence.  Where we particularly should be taking issue with the mass media use of the past is when it is used for escapism from the present.

      "In the vernacular, 'archives' is often used to refer to any collection of documents that are old or of historical interest, regardless of how they are organized; in this sense, the term is synonymous with permanent records.  That use is reflected by archives", 
      "Many archivists, especially those in the United States who are influenced by the thinking of Theodore Schellenberg, follow an inclusive definition of archives, which encompasses a wide variety of documents and records.  Schellenberg also distinguished between the primary and secondary value of the materials; only materials with secondary value, value beyond their original purpose, could be considered archival. For Schellenberg, archivists appraise records for transfer to the archives on the basis of their secondary, research, evidential, or informational value. \r\n\r\n", 
      "Other archivists follow the writing of Hilary Jenkinson, who argues that archives are 'documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference.'  For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation.  Because Jenkinson emphasized that records are evidence of transactions, he did not recognize any collections of historical documents as archives, although he noted that collections of personal papers were of value to historians because they complemented archives. \r\n\r\n", 
      "'Manuscript repository' is sometimes used instead of archives", 
      "Some United States archivists deprecate the use of the form 'archive' (without the final s) as a noun, but that form is common in other English-speaking countries.  However, the noun 'archive' is commonly used to describe collections of backup data in information technology literature."

        "quotation": "\u0086107\u00a0(Greene 1998a, p. 157): At least three things are glaringly obvious about the utilitarian approach to records appraisal.  The first is that it is not perfect.  Of course, if no archival theory or practice could be allowed unless it was 'perfect,' we would have not theory or practice.  Ultimately, the question becomes whether appraisal based on [use analysis], granted its many imperfections, is better or worse than the proposed practical alternatives. The second is that its practicality and broad applicability depends upon a growing number of use studies. Because every repository serves a somewhat different clientele, has a different mandate from its resource allocators, and must deploy different resources, in an ideal world, every repository would do it own detailed use studies for every segment of its collections.  These could be as simple as the MHS call-slip analysis, as complex as a process of user interviews, or as intensive as a citation analysis.  The world not being ideal, most repositories will have to extrapolate from studies done by similar institutions regarding similar records.  The third is that this is not a Magic Bullet.  Utilitarian appraisal does not equal 'easy' appraisal.  Unless we abandon appraisal as an archival responsibility, we will never make appraisal easy because we can never make it scientific or mechanistic.  If it were otherwise, I am convinced, there would be absolutely no reason for archivists to exist.  But a utilitarian method will provide a better rigor and rationale for appraisal decisions."

In the legal sense an alleged signatory to a document is always able to repudiate a signature that has been attributed to him or her. The basis for a repudiation of a traditional signature may include: \r\nThe signature is a forgery; \r\nThe signature is not a forgery, but was obtained via\r\n  unconscionable conduct by a party to a transaction,  \r\n  fraud instigated by a third party, \r\n  undue influence exerted by a third party.  \r\n\r\n\u00b6 There appears to be a movement within the electronic commerce environment to take away these fundamental rights that exist within common law jurisdictions. The general rule of evidence is that if a person denies a particular signature then it falls upon the relying party to prove that the signature is truly that of the person denying it. It should be understood that the term 'deny' and the term 'repudiate' are synonymous and this position is supported by standard dictionary definitions. \r\n\r\n\u00b6  Furthermore, the common law trust mechanism established to overcome a false claim of non-repudiation is witnessing. Witnessing simply occurs at the time the signature is being affixed. That is, by having an independent adult witness the signing of a document reduces the ability of the signatory to successfully deny the signature as a forgery at a later date. It is always open for the signatory to deny the signature on other grounds such as those enumerated above.  [Citations omitted.]"

Therefore, it's up to individual companies to determine what information qualifies as intellectual and knowledge-based assets. In general, however, intellectual and knowledge-based assets fall into one of two categories: explicit or tacit. Included among the former are assets such as patents, trademarks, business plans, marketing research and customer lists. As a general rule of thumb, explicit knowledge consists of anything that can be documented, archived and codified, often with the help of IT. Much harder to grasp is the concept of tacit knowledge, or the know-how contained in people's heads. The challenge inherent with tacit knowledge is figuring out how to recognize, generate, share and manage it. While IT in the form of e-mail, groupware, instant messaging and related technologies can help facilitate the dissemination of tacit knowledge, identifying tacit knowledge in the first place is a major hurdle for most organizations."

While it is the task of paleography to determine what type of script is proper to an era and an environment, it is the task of diplomatics to examine other characteristics of the script, such as the layout of the writing with respect to the physical form of the document, the presence of different hands or types of writing in the same document, the correspondence between paragraphs and conceptual sections of the text, type of punctuation, abbreviations, initialisms, ink, erasures, corrections, etc. With the invention of the printing press, and later, of the typewriter, some of these characteristics became irrelevant to the purpose of diplomatic criticism.  The need for careful examination of these characteristics is arising again, however, thanks to the advent of new technology.  Computer software, for example, may be considered as part of the extrinsic 'script,' because it determines the layout and articulation of the discourse, and can provide information about provenance, procedures, processes, uses, modes of transmission and, last but not least, authenticity."

The strategy they propose includes: defining a collecting area; analyzing existing collections; determining the documentary universe, including relevant government records, printed and other sources; prioritizing industrial sectors, individual businesses, geographic regions, and time periods from which records will be sought; defining functions performed by businesses and the collecting levels needed to document major functions; connecting documentary levels to priority tiers; and updating this process every three to seven years. They outline priority factors used in making these decisions, documentation levels, and decision points to refine the priority levels. This Minnesota Method combines features of archival approaches to collection analysis, documentation strategy, appraisal, and functional analysis."

      "Edge-notched cards have some information written in the body.  The holes at the edge are associated with a specific attribute about the subject to be coded for retrieval.  A hole is cut out (notched) if the card is to be retrieved for that piece of information.  When a thin rod is inserted through the hole associated with an attribute, cards with that hole notched out are not picked up by the rod.  Several rods may be inserted to retrieve cards based on more than one attribute.\r\n\r\n", 
      "For example, cards may be created for each member of a group.  An individual's name is written on the card, and possibly other information.  Appropriate holes assigned for age and ethnicity are notched.  Inserting rods into the holes for a specific age and a specific ethnicity will allow cards that have been notched for both that age and ethnicity to fall out of the cards that are not notched and remain on the rods."

A bibliographic description, such as that found in a MARC record, represents an individual published item, and thus is item-level. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the description and the item. The description is based on, and is derived from, the physical item. Archival description represents a fonds, a complex body of materials, frequently in more than one form or medium, sharing a common provenance. The description involves a complex hierarchical and progressive analysis. It begins by describing the whole, then proceeds to identify and describe sub-components of the whole, and sub-components of sub-components, and so on. Frequently, but by no means always, the description terminates with a description of individual items. The description emphasizes the intellectual structure and content of the material, rather than their physical characteristics."

Letters as a form of personal correspondence had of course existed for many centuries.  They were already used in commerce, mainly for external communication.  The conventions of letter writing were well established.  These included the date of writing, a formal salutation ('Dear . . . ') as well as a formal closing ('Your most . . .') . . . As the letter was increasingly used for internal communication, within and across departments, the new business experts, masters of efficiency, argued for a much simplified format.  Typing time could be saved if the company printed up letterheads with fields such as To, From, and Subject, and if openings and closings were stripped down to a bare minimum. . . . \u00b6 . . . The 'Subject' field had a double purpose.  It of course gave the recipient a quick way to determine what the memo was about.  But it was equally important as a resource for a new class of workers, the file clerk.  It helped the clerk determine where in the vertical files to store the memo."

Thus, no organisational view on data existed. These different data definitions also lead to inconsistent reports that cannot be used by management for decision making. In turn, the inconsistent reports cause users not to trust reports and organisational data. These problems were aggravated by the fact that data that went into the DSS systems were sometimes 'dirty' or inaccurate as there was no 'scrubbing' or cleansing process to ensure accurate data, presented in a uniform format. Lastly, data were shared reluctantly in business-unit-centric systems, and the data were not integrated, requiring complicated bridges to share data [citing Moss & Adelman 1999a]. The shortcomings of DSS systems became profound as the users of these systems changed from administrators at a tactical level to analysts and managers at the strategic level."

A negative is made of a drawing, producing a brownprint; the brownprint is then reprinted to make a positive (brownline).  A variety of other processes have been used to make prints described as brownlines and brownprints, although the Vandyke process is one the earliest.  Manufactured since the 1890s, this process was frequently found on medium or lightweight paper as the print was often used as an intermediary to create negatives or positives of damaged original drawings."

      "In principle, an item can be reformatted without any effect on its content.  For example, a nitrate negative can be reformatted by making a duplicate on safety film.  However, Marshall McLuhan's observation that \"The medium is the message\" is a reminder that physical characteristics influence meaning.  In the case of a reformatted photograph, some information embedded in the material nature of the original will be lost in the reproduction.  For example, a modern copy print of a 19th-century cabinet print will almost certainly use a different process, may not be the same size, and may not reproduce the back; the process, size, and date, which can help date the original, are missing from the reformatted copy.\r\n\r\n", 
      "Data files may be reformatted so that they can be read by different programs or to counter technological obsolescence.  For example, a document created in Word 5 must be reformatted before it can be read by Word XP or by any version of WordPerfect.  Or, home movies may be reformatted to DVDs.  Such reformatting may be imperfect, with a resulting loss of meaning."

      "The use of 'archivist' to describe a manuscript curator is common in the United States.  Some archives use the phrase to distinguish responsibilities for different types of materials.  For example, a manuscript curator is responsible for collections of textual documents, while a photograph curator is responsible for collections of photographs. 'Manuscript curator' is also used by some to distinguish individuals responsible for assembled or acquired collections, or for collections unconnected to the archives' parent organization.  'Manuscript curator' is sometimes related to the historical manuscripts tradition, which relied on techniques of curating materials based on principles of librarianship that emphasized item-level control rather than collection-level control."

Most often, incoming records are housed in modern office-quality folders and boxes that meet short-term rather than long-term retention requirements. \r\n\r\n\u00b6  With these points in mind, a holdings maintenance program has three major procedural objectives: \r\nto place documents into a good primary housing (a container that fully encloses them, supports them, and protects them from the environment); \r\nwithin the container, to group documents into folders for additional protection and support and to enhance safe access; \r\nto place documents that are severely damaged or vulnerable into individual enclosures. \r\n\r\n\u00b6  Also defined in a holdings maintenance program are the four functional, design, and compositional features of the housing supplies \u0096 the containers, folders, and sleeves \u0096 used during the course of work: \r\nhousings and enclosures must perform their assigned function; \r\nthey must be as simple and straightforward to use as possible to facilitate easy and safe access to the documents; \r\nthey must not contain any structural features that will physically damage or jeopardize the documents; \r\nthey must be made of stable materials that will not contribute to the deterioration of the documents in the present or the future."

These formulae constitute the final clauses, which can be divided into groups as follows: \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of injunction: those expressing the obligation of all those concerned to conform to the will of the authority. \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of prohibition: those expressing the prohibition to violate the enactment or oppose it. \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of derogation: those expressing the obligation to respect the enactment, notwithstanding other orders or decisions contrary to it, opposition, appeals or previous dispositions. \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of exception: those expressing situations, conditions or persons which would constitute an exception to the enactment. \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of obligation: those expressing the obligation of the parties to respect the act, for themselves and for their successors or descendants. \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of renunciation: those expressing a threat of punishment should the enactment be violated.  They comprise two categories: 1) spiritual sanctions, comprising threats of malediction or anathema; 2) penal sanctions, comprising the mention of specific penal consequences. \r\n\u00b6 Promissory clauses: those expressing the promise of a prize, usually of a spiritual nature, for those who respect the enactment. \r\n\u00b6 Clauses of corroboration: those enunciating the means used to validate the document and guarantee its authenticity.  The wording changes according to the time and place, but these clauses are usually formulaic and fixed.

Sponsored by The Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM) and The Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies (NPES), the committee is working to establish an archival standard for Adobe\u0092s Portable Document Format (PDF). Known as PDF-A, the potential standard intends to specify a limited, stable subset of PDF for text-based documents that must remain valid for a number of years. The effort has been underway since 2002, and the ultimate aim is to have PDF-A endorsed and owned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)."

The National Archives joined the automation effort in 1967, and developed a derivative system from SPINDEX geared more specifically for archival collections at NARA called SPINDEX II. \u00b6\r\n\r\nSPINDEX II focused on providing access to archival collections by automating previously prepared and published finding aids.   \u00b6\r\n\r\nThe National Archives used SPINDEX II extensively throughout the 1970s, producing among other guides, the first comprehensive index to the Papers of the Continental Congress in conjunction with the American Bicentennial. NARA also used the system to prepare up-to-date collection guides (subject-based, and format-based) as well as the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's Directory of Archives and Manuscript Repositories. NARA did make the SPINDEX II system available to other organizations, and the system was used widely both as an archival control program, but also in a records management capacity for many corporations in the United States, Canada, and Australia.\r\n\r\n"

For example, the U.S. National Archives subjected all incoming records to ethylene oxide fumigation as a precautionary measure for several decades.

For instance, the primary value of probate court records is to govern the distribution of a deceased person's property, but these records are also invaluable to historians studying family wealth or tastes and genealogists nourishing a family tree. The secondary values of a record are long lasting and are the main concern of the archival appraiser."

That is, if r1 and r2 are the (absolute) rates of deterioration of a specific paper under two sets of temperature and relative humidity conditions we shall not deal with r1 and r2 individually but only with their ratio r2/r1 which measures the relative change in the deterioration rate resulting from the change in environmental conditions.\r\n\r\n"

From 1994-1997 the USMARC and CAN/MARC user communities worked to eliminate all remaining differences in their two already-similar formats. Compatibility had been a feature of the development processes for both formats for many years. In 1997 and early 1998, updates to the formats were issued that made the format specifications identical.

      "Archivist Oliver Wendell Holmes identified five levels of arrangement: repository; collection or record group; series; folder; and item.  Many archives arrange records only to the folder level, although some archives arrange the items within each folder.  Arrangement is often combined with the process of rehousing materials into archival containers and folders, and includes the labeling and shelving of materials. Though not widely practiced, arrangement can be employed in an intellectual sense, without a corresponding physical ordering of material.  For example, five folders stored in four different boxes can be listed together in a finding aid as an ordered series without changing their storage location. \r\n\r\n", 
      "Arrangement with respect to original order presumes such an order is discernable.  Archivists are not required to preserve 'original chaos', and may arrange such materials in a way that facilitates their use and management without violation of any archival principle. \r\n\r\n", 
      "Arrangement is distinguished from classification, which places materials in an order established by someone other than the creator."

Archivists make the distinction between an archival fonds, where the items are of known provenance and their arrangement reflects their original working order as the records of an organisation or individual, and an 'artificial collection,' where the items are associated but lack the coherence of a fonds. The archivist recognises the fonds as the set of items that have been created and accumulated by an identifiable individual body (or bodies). However, it should be emphasised that both these classes of aggregates (the fonds and the artificial collection) are 'collections' in the more general sense in which the term is used here. Within an archival fonds, an item can be fully understood only within the context of its relationship with other items and aggregates in the fonds, and descriptive practice reflects this."

Ever since Paul Delaroche purportedly exclaimed, 'From today, painting is dead,' the photograph has been perceived as an objective record of reality, the product of a mechanical and therefore neutral means of documentation. . . .  Photographs derive the authority of their content from realism and accuracy, what J. B. Harley calls 'talismans' of authority; archival photographs convey their message through function and context. . . . The photograph is neither truth nor reality, but a representation willed into existence for a purpose and mediated by the persons concurring in its formation."

      "Most traditional photographic processes use a silver halide as the light-sensitive material, although light-sensitive salts of copper, iron, and uranium have been used as well.  The silver halide is reduced to metallic silver in black-and-white photographs and is used to form a dye in color photographs.  In the 19th century, collodion was commonly used as a binder for negatives, prints, ambrotypes, and tintypes, and albumen was the most common binder for prints.  Most modern photographic processes use gelatin to bind the silver halide to a film, paper, or glass support.  \r\n\r\n",

The life cycle model argues that there are clearly definable stages in record-keeping and creates a sharp distinction between current and historical record-keeping. The record continuum, on the other hand, has provided Australian records managers and archivists with a way of thinking about the integration of record-keeping and archiving processes.\r\n\r\n\u00b6  The life cycle model sees records passing through stages until they eventually 'die', except for the 'chosen ones' that are reincarnated as archives. A continuum-based approach suggests integrated time-space dimensions. Records are 'fixed' in time and space from the moment of their creation, but record-keeping regimes carry them forward and enable their use for multiple purposes by delivering them to people living in different times and spaces.

Such aspects, properties, or characteristics are called facets of a class or subject, a term introduced into classification theory and given this new meaning by the Indian librarian and classificationist S. R. Ranganathan and first used in his Colon Classification in the early 1930s.  Although the term was then new to classification, the idea was not (as Ranganathan freely admitted).  It had its roots in Dewey's device of place (location) as using a standard number (e.g., the United States always being 73) appended to any subject number by means of digits 09, a device now known as a facet indicator."

In its search for an ideal mass deacidification process, the Library invented and further developed the diethyl zinc (DEZ) gaseous process and also brought about key improvements in solvent-based, liquid phase processes. In the conservation science community, gaseous processes have traditionally been deemed to have a significant edge over liquid phase, solvent-based processes, mainly because they preclude any possibility of adverse effects on inks, dyes and colored pigments in manuscripts, color plates and book covers due to bleeding or softening of inks."

Anyone can use an individual's public key to encrypt a message that only the individual can decrypt using the private key. Public key cryptography was a breakthrough because it was the first technology that not require keys be exchanged in advance.  Two individuals, each with their own public and private keys, can send each other messages that are completely confidential.  Alice sends Bob messages using Bob's public key; only Bob has the key to decrypt and read her messages.  Bob sends Alice messages using Alice's public key; only Alice has the private key to read his messages.\r\n\r\n",

Primary values are those reflecting the basic business purpose(s) served by the records, the reason they were created. Secondary values reflect other uses to which the information may be put during the course of their life cycle, uses that may justify continuing retention after the expiration of primary values. Administrative or operational values are usually identified as primary values. Research or historical values are generally designated as secondary values. Legal value can be either a primary or a secondary value, depending on the purpose and function of a record. A records series can (and usually does) possess several of these values simultaneously, and they may change during a record\u0092s life cycle."

The Johns Hopkins Variorum Edition of Edmund Spenser, for instance, includes notes not only by that edition's editors, but by dozens of earlier critics, going back to the eighteenth century: for any passage in Spenser, the reader can see what earlier commentators have had to say about it.\r\n\r\n\u00b6  Other variorum editions reproduce not critical commentary but textual variants and conjectural emendations proposed by many other editors. The Arden Shakespeare, for example, gives the readings in all the important early witnesses (the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century quartos and folios), and, when they're relevant, the readings proposed by editors from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries."

The most important of all principles of Archive Management is named from it le respect pour les fonds. . . . A fonds is an organic whole and that any Administration, or one or more of its fonctionnaires, can create a fonds d'archives provided that these include r\u00e9solutions or proc\u00e8s-verbaux; the inclusion of archives of such a type making it autonome. Roughly speaking, we may take it that they would make the qualities of a fonds d'archives depend on its including those which, when the administration which created it was active, constituted the final authority for executive action. For our purposes we may do better perhaps to represent this quality in terms of Administration rather than terms of documents, the forms of which are not necessarily constant.  Fonds we may render, for lack of a better translation, Archive Group, and define this as the Archives resulting from the work of an Administration which was an organic whole, complete in itself, capable of dealing independently, without any added or external authority, with every side of any business which could normally be presented to it.  This, it may be said, is to make the Archive Group a division much wider, much less strictly defined that the Fonds."

Early full-text searching was limited, especially in its ability to distinguish different senses of a word; a search for glass might find documents relating to Philip Glass, window glass, and glass ice.  More sophisticated search engines could use several terms, with Boolean logic and adjacency rules, to help narrow false hits.  Modern search engines seen on the web use a variety of similar techniques to rank documents in terms of likely relevancy."

Examples of juridical persons are states, agencies, corporations, associations, committees, partnerships, ethnic and religious groups, positions to which individuals are nominated, appointed, or hired, character groups (women, fathers, children, deceased persons), the estates of bankrupt or deceased persons, counties, and so on. . . . In English, the United States, and English-speaking Canada, there is a legal distinction between 'natural' and 'artificial' persons which is close to the distinction between physical and juridical persons, but the jurists in those countries do not agree on a definition of the two terms."

They have residual value because they document the outcomes of the directing and controlling activities and because they provide evidence of an organization's rights as well as its obligations to its staff and society.

      "See narrower terms for more specific definitions of different types of records. The use of the general term 'record' when referring to a particular type of record inevitably leads to confusion because attributes of the particular type are not conveyed by the general term. In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations.  The general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301, cited below), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC \u00a7 552(a), cited below).   See also business record, which is defined in the Rules of Federal Evidence. ", 
      "Records are not synonymous with archives. While an archives collects records, not all records merit ongoing preservation.", 
      "'Record' connotes documents, rather than artifacts or published materials, although collections of records may contain artifacts and books.  To the extent that records are defined in terms of their function rather than their characteristics, the definition is stretched to include many materials not normally understood to be a record; an artifact may function as a record, even though it falls outside the vernacular understanding of the definition.\r\n\r\n", 
      "A record", 
      "A document\u0092s structure is contained within boundaries, which define the record as a unit and give it identity by distinguishing it from other information.  A record may consist of many physically or logically discrete parts that function together as unit, such as several pages or data values from many tables.  However, those parts must be bound together in some fashion.\r\n\r\n", 
      "Records may be in any format, including text, images, or sound.  However, the concept of record is ultimately independent of any specific carrier or format.  Paper records may be microfilmed, and electronic records may be transferred from memory to disk to paper.  \r\n\r\n", 
      "A record is often unique, whereas a publication is always created in multiple copies.  However, a record may be a single copy of many that has been selected for preservation or special treatment (a record copy).  For example, a publisher may keep one copy of each publication as a record. \r\n\r\n", 
      "Record", 
      "'Record' is frequently used synonymously with 'document'.  To the extent the vernacular uses 'record' to refer to any document, without specification, the terms are synonymous.  However, the concept of record is independent of format, and it includes things that are clearly not documents.  For example, an artifact may serve as a record if it is preserved to bolster human memory or to demonstrate accountability.\r\n\r\n", 
      "Records are sometimes distinguished from papers, with 'records' referring to items that were generated as the result of routine activities or a transactions, especially those of an organization.  'Papers' refer to documents created on a more or less ad hoc basis, especially those of an individual."
