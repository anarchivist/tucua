Most often, incoming records are housed in modern office-quality folders and boxes that meet short-term rather than long-term retention requirements. 

¶  With these points in mind, a holdings maintenance program has three major procedural objectives: 
to place documents into a good primary housing (a container that fully encloses them, supports them, and protects them from the environment); 
within the container, to group documents into folders for additional protection and support and to enhance safe access; 
to place documents that are severely damaged or vulnerable into individual enclosures. 

¶  Also defined in a holdings maintenance program are the four functional, design, and compositional features of the housing supplies – the containers, folders, and sleeves – used during the course of work: 
housings and enclosures must perform their assigned function; 
they must be as simple and straightforward to use as possible to facilitate easy and safe access to the documents; 
they must not contain any structural features that will physically damage or jeopardize the documents; 
they must be made of stable materials that will not contribute to the deterioration of the documents in the present or the future.""";

These factors included not only the well known litany of pesticide misuse problems (resistance and non-target effects), but also the rapid development of technologies enabling more sophisticated approaches, primarily due to rapid advances in communication and computing, with the allied new sciences of operations research, systems analysis, and modeling.  ¶ 

Although much of the initial push for IPM came from California researchers in sympathetic response to Rachael Carson's Silent Spring, national acceptance of IPM as a philosophy and technology can be traced to 1970 to the first symposium of agricultural scientists brought together to discuss IPM in a conference held at North Carolina State University, which was jointly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, NSF, and USDA/CSRS.""";

¶ What is at first sometimes confusing but is essential to an understanding of isoperms is that relative rather than absolute rates of deterioration (and paper permanence) are employed. That is, if r1 and r2 are the (absolute) rates of deterioration of a specific paper under two sets of temperature and relative humidity conditions we shall not deal with r1 and r2 individually but only with their ratio r2/r1 which measures the relative change in the deterioration rate resulting from the change in environmental conditions.""";

For internal management purposes, a library must have access to appropriate technical metadata in order to periodically refresh and migrate the data, ensuring the durability of valuable resources.

¶  The Making of America II project (MOA2) attempted to address these issues in part by providing an encoding format for descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata for textual and image-based works. METS, a Digital Library Federation initiative, attempts to build upon the work of MOA2 and provide an XML document format for encoding metadata necessary for both management of digital library objects within a repository and exchange of such objects between repositories (or between repositories and their users). Depending on its use, a METS document could be used in the role of Submission Information Package (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP), or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model.""";

The strategy they propose includes: defining a collecting area; analyzing existing collections; determining the documentary universe, including relevant government records, printed and other sources; prioritizing industrial sectors, individual businesses, geographic regions, and time periods from which records will be sought; defining functions performed by businesses and the collecting levels needed to document major functions; connecting documentary levels to priority tiers; and updating this process every three to seven years.

            mads:citationNote """†(McCullagh and Caelli 2000) There is a definitional distinction between the legal use of the term 'non-repudiation' and its crypto-technical use. In the legal sense an alleged signatory to a document is always able to repudiate a signature that has been attributed to him or her. The basis for a repudiation of a traditional signature may include: 
The signature is a forgery; 
The signature is not a forgery, but was obtained via
  unconscionable conduct by a party to a transaction,  
  fraud instigated by a third party, 
  undue influence exerted by a third party.  

¶ There appears to be a movement within the electronic commerce environment to take away these fundamental rights that exist within common law jurisdictions. The general rule of evidence is that if a person denies a particular signature then it falls upon the relying party to prove that the signature is truly that of the person denying it. It should be understood that the term 'deny' and the term 'repudiate' are synonymous and this position is supported by standard dictionary definitions. 

¶  Furthermore, the common law trust mechanism established to overcome a false claim of non-repudiation is witnessing. Witnessing simply occurs at the time the signature is being affixed. That is, by having an independent adult witness the signing of a document reduces the ability of the signatory to successfully deny the signature as a forgery at a later date. It is always open for the signatory to deny the signature on other grounds such as those enumerated above.  [Citations omitted.]""";

Successful outreach requires an environmental assessment of community (potential constituent) needs, potential partners and resources, and potential impact.

Early carbon inks, which merely lay on the surface of the parchment, could be removed more or less completely simply by sponging, but the later iron gall inks were much more difficult to remove because of the interaction with the fibers of the tannin present in the ink. They had to be scraped and then treated with a weak acid, such as the citric acid of an orange. Even then traces of the original writing remained. Wetting the parchment in this manner softened it to such an extent that it was necessary to treat the skin with dry lime to make it dry and white once again.

The National Archives joined the automation effort in 1967, and developed a derivative system from SPINDEX geared more specifically for archival collections at NARA called SPINDEX II. ¶

SPINDEX II focused on providing access to archival collections by automating previously prepared and published finding aids.   ¶

The National Archives used SPINDEX II extensively throughout the 1970s, producing among other guides, the first comprehensive index to the Papers of the Continental Congress in conjunction with the American Bicentennial. NARA also used the system to prepare up-to-date collection guides (subject-based, and format-based) as well as the National Historical Publications and Records Commission's Directory of Archives and Manuscript Repositories. NARA did make the SPINDEX II system available to other organizations, and the system was used widely both as an archival control program, but also in a records management capacity for many corporations in the United States, Canada, and Australia.""";

¶ It has always been much more ambitious, proposing an entire form of literature where links do not break as versions change; where documents may be closely compared side by side and closely annotated; where it is possible to see the origins of every quotation; and in which there is a valid copyright system – a literary, legal and business arrangement – for frictionless, non-negotiated quotation at any time and in any amount.  The Web trivialized this original Xanadu model, vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking one-way links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use.  Fonts and glitz, rather than content connective structure, prevail. 

¶ Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations. 

¶ Xanalogical literary structure is a unique symmetrical connective system for text (and other separable media elements), with two complementary forms of connection that achieve these functions – survivable deep linkage (content links) and recognizable, visible re-use (transclusion).  Both of these are easily implemented by a document model using content lists which reference stabilized media.""";

Bit preservation ensures that a file remains exactly the same over time – not a single bit is changed – while the physical media evolve around it. Functional preservation goes further: the file does change over time so that the material continues to be immediately usable in the same way it was originally while the digital formats (and the physical media) evolve over time. Some file formats can be functionally preserved using straightforward format migration (e.g. TIFF images or XML documents). Other formats are proprietary, or for other reasons are much harder to preserve functionally";

            mads:citationNote "†(Fed. Reg., 66:47 (9 March 2001), p. 14099.) The copyright laws of the United States grant certain rights to copyright owners for the protection of their works of authorship. Among these rights is the right to make, and to authorize others to make, a reproduction of the copyrighted work, and the right to distribute, and to authorize others to distribute, the copyrighted work. Both the reproduction right and the distribution right granted to a copyright owner inhere in all works of authorship and are, for the most part, exclusive rights. However, for copyright holders of nondramatic musical works, the exclusivity of the reproduction right and distribution right are limited by the compulsory license of section 115 of the Copyright Act. Often referred to as the 'mechanical license,' section 115 grants third parties a nonexclusive license to make and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. The license can be invoked once a nondramatic musical work embodied in a phonorecord is distributed 'to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner.' 17 U.S.C. 115(a)(1). Unless and until such an act occurs, the copyright owner's rights in the musical work remain exclusive, and the compulsory license does not apply. Once it does occur, the license permits anyone to make and distribute phonorecords of the musical work provided, of course, that they comply with all of the royalty and accounting requirements of section 115. It is important to note that the mechanical license only permits the making and distribution of phonorecords of a musical work, and does not permit the use of a sound recording created by someone else. The compulsory licensee must either assemble his own musicians, singers, recording engineers and equipment, or obtain permission from the copyright owner to use a preexisting sound recording. One who obtains permission to use another's sound recording is eligible to use the compulsory license for the musical composition that is performed on the sound recording. The mechanical license was the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law, having its origin in the 1909 Copyright Act. It operated successfully for many years, and it continued under the 1976 Copyright Act with only some technical modifications. However, in 1995, Congress passed the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act ('Digital Performance Act'), Public Law 104-39, 109 Stat. 336, which amended sections 114 and 115 of the Copyright Act to take account of technological changes which were beginning to enable digital transmission of sound recordings. With respect to section 115, the Act expanded the scope of the mechanical license to include the right to distribute, or authorize the distribution of, a phonorecord by means of a digital transmission which constitutes a 'digital phonorecord delivery.'";

Letters as a form of personal correspondence had of course existed for many centuries.  They were already used in commerce, mainly for external communication.  The conventions of letter writing were well established.  These included the date of writing, a formal salutation ('Dear . . . ') as well as a formal closing ('Your most . . .') . . . As the letter was increasingly used for internal communication, within and across departments, the new business experts, masters of efficiency, argued for a much simplified format.  Typing time could be saved if the company printed up letterheads with fields such as To, From, and Subject, and if openings and closings were stripped down to a bare minimum. . . . ¶ . . . The 'Subject' field had a double purpose.  It of course gave the recipient a quick way to determine what the memo was about.  But it was equally important as a resource for a new class of workers, the file clerk.  It helped the clerk determine where in the vertical files to store the memo.";

Codd, father of the relational database, and his associates have produced a white paper listing the 12 rules for OLAP (on-line analytical processing) systems. The list is fundamentally a formula for a successful information system, whether you call it an EIS, a DSS, or a business information system. ¶  
 1. Multidimensional conceptual view. This supports EIS 'slice-and-dice'
    operations and is usually required in financial modeling. – 
 2. Transparency. OLAP systems should be part of an open system that
    supports heterogeneous data sources. Furthermore, the end user should
    not have to be concerned about the details of data access or conversions. – 
 3. Accessibility. The OLAP should present the
 user with a single logical schema of the data.  – 
 4. Consistent reporting performance. Performance should not degrade
    as the number of dimensions in the model increases.  – 
 5. Client/server architecture. Requirement for open, modular systems. – 
 6. Generic dimensionality. Not limited to 3-D and not biased toward
    any particular dimension. A function applied to one dimension
    should also be able to be applied to another. – 
 7. Dynamic sparse-matrix handling. Related both to the idea of nulls
    in relational databases and to the notion of compressing large files,
    a sparse matrix is one in which not every cell contains data. OLAP
    systems should accommodate varying storage and data-handling options. – 
 8. Multiuser support. OLAP systems, like EISes, need to support
    multiple concurrent users, including their individual views or
    slices of a common database. – 
 9. Unrestricted cross-dimensional operations. Similar to rule 6; all
    dimensions are created equal, and operations across data dimensions
    do not restrict relationships between cells. – 
10. Intuitive data manipulation. Ideally, users shouldn't have to use
    menus or perform complex multiple-step operations when an intuitive
    drag-and-drop action will do. – 
11. Flexible reporting. Save a tree. Users should be able to print just
    what they need, and any changes to the underlying financial model
    should be automatically reflected in reports. – 
12. Unlimited dimensional and aggregation levels. A serious tool
    should support at least 15, and preferably 20, dimensions.""";

The photographer could monitor the printing progress in reduced light by pulling the paper away from the negative; if more exposure was needed, the sandwich was returned to sunlight to continue printing.  After exposure, the prints were fixed to halt further development.  Printing-out papers produce images that are a purplish brown and were usually toned to a purple black.

However, by generalizing the concept of a 'Web resource', RDF can also be used to represent information about things that can be identified on the Web, even when they cannot be directly retrieved on the Web. Examples include information about items available from on-line shopping facilities (e.g., information about specifications, prices, and availability), or the description of a Web user's preferences for information delivery.

            mads:citationNote "†(Greene 1998a, p. 157) At least three things are glaringly obvious about the utilitarian approach to records appraisal.  The first is that it is not perfect.  Of course, if no archival theory or practice could be allowed unless it was 'perfect,' we would have not theory or practice.  Ultimately, the question becomes whether appraisal based on [use analysis], granted its many imperfections, is better or worse than the proposed practical alternatives. The second is that its practicality and broad applicability depends upon a growing number of use studies. Because every repository serves a somewhat different clientele, has a different mandate from its resource allocators, and must deploy different resources, in an ideal world, every repository would do it own detailed use studies for every segment of its collections.  These could be as simple as the MHS call-slip analysis, as complex as a process of user interviews, or as intensive as a citation analysis.  The world not being ideal, most repositories will have to extrapolate from studies done by similar institutions regarding similar records.  The third is that this is not a Magic Bullet.  Utilitarian appraisal does not equal 'easy' appraisal.  Unless we abandon appraisal as an archival responsibility, we will never make appraisal easy because we can never make it scientific or mechanistic.  If it were otherwise, I am convinced, there would be absolutely no reason for archivists to exist.  But a utilitarian method will provide a better rigor and rationale for appraisal decisions.";

Because 'mainframe' describes older systems, the term 'supercomputer' was introduced to describe a new class of very powerful computers, especially very fast or massively-parallel architectures.  'Minicomputer' was used to describe smaller systems, especially those with all components contained in a single cabinet. The term has generally fallen out of use.  'Microcomputer' and 'personal computer' (PC) are near synonyms that refer to small systems that rely on a single-chip central processing unit (CPU).   'Workstation' connotes a very powerful microcomputer designed for use by an individual for processor-intensive applications but is often used to mean any personal computer.  Given the increase of speed and capacity of hardware, the distinctions between these categories of computers are significantly blurred by the fact that many modern laptops are more powerful than early mainframes.

The image appears as a positive when viewed while reflecting a dark background and as a negative when reflecting a light background.  The image is monochromatic, although color may have been added by hand.  Unless special camera optics were used, the image is laterally reversed.  The surface is fragile and may be tarnished.

As the technology came into common use, a screw-powered letter press was used in conjunction with a press book, a bound volume of blank, tissue paper pages.  A letter freshly written in special copying ink was placed on a dampened page while the rest of the pages were protected by oilcloths.  The book was then closed and the mechanical press screwed down tightly.  The pressure and moisture caused an impression of the letter to be retained on the underside of the tissue sheet.  This impression could then be read through the top of the thin paper. ¶ These letter presses were used by some individuals and businessmen in the first half of the nineteenth century, but they only came into general use in the second half of the century. ¶ A letter press reduced the labor cost, both by decreasing copying time and by allowing an office boy to do the copying once performed by a more expensive clerk.  As the same time, it eliminated the danger of miscopying.  Copies were now facsimiles of the letter sent, down to the signature.";

The record continuum, on the other hand, has provided Australian records managers and archivists with a way of thinking about the integration of record-keeping and archiving processes.

¶  The life cycle model sees records passing through stages until they eventually 'die', except for the 'chosen ones' that are reincarnated as archives. A continuum-based approach suggests integrated time-space dimensions.

            mads:citationNote """†(W3C/IETF URI Planning 2001) There is some confusion in the web community over the partitioning of URI space, specifically, the relationship among the concepts of URL, URN, and URI. The confusion owes to the incompatibility between two different views of URI partitioning, which we call the 'classical' and 'contemporary' views.

¶¶  1.1 Classical View
¶  During the early years of discussion of web identifiers (early to mid 90s), people assumed that an identifier type would be cast into one of two (or possibly more) classes. An identifier might specify the location of a resource (a URL) or its name (a URN) independent of location. Thus a URI was either a URL or a URN. There was discussion about generalizing this by addition of a discrete number of additional classes; for example, a URI might point to metadata rather than the resource itself, in which case the URI would be a URC (citation). URI space was thus viewed as partitioned into subspaces: URL and URN, and additional subspaces, to be defined. The only such additional space ever proposed was URC and there never was any buy-in; so without loss of generality it's reasonable to say that URI space was thought to be partitioned into two classes: URL and URN. Thus for example, 'http:' was a URL scheme, and 'isbn:' would (someday) be a URN scheme. Any new scheme would be cast into one or the other of these two classes.

¶¶  1.2 Contemporary View
¶  Over time, the importance of this additional level of hierarchy seemed to lessen; the view became that an individual scheme does not need to be cast into one of a discrete set of URI types such as 'URL', 'URN', 'URC', etc. Web-identifier schemes are in general URI schemes; a given URI scheme may define subspaces. Thus 'http:' is a URI scheme. 'urn:' is also a URI scheme; it defines subspaces, called 'namespaces'. For example, the set of URNs of the form 'urn:isbn:n-nn-nnnnnn-n' is a URN namespace. ('isbn' is an URN namespace identifier. It is not a 'URN scheme' nor a 'URI scheme').

¶  Further according to the contemporary view, the term 'URL' does not refer to a formal partition of URI space; rather, URL is a useful but informal concept: a URL is a type of URI that identifies a resource via a representation of its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network 'location'), rather than by some other attributes it may have. Thus as we noted, 'http:' is a URI scheme. An http URI is a URL. The phrase 'URL scheme' is now used infrequently, usually to refer to some subclass of URI schemes which exclude URNs.""";

¶ A variorum edition  gives not only the text the editor established, or the editor's own notes, but those of earlier critics as well. The Johns Hopkins Variorum Edition of Edmund Spenser, for instance, includes notes not only by that edition's editors, but by dozens of earlier critics, going back to the eighteenth century: for any passage in Spenser, the reader can see what earlier commentators have had to say about it.

¶  Other variorum editions reproduce not critical commentary but textual variants and conjectural emendations proposed by many other editors. The Arden Shakespeare, for example, gives the readings in all the important early witnesses (the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century quartos and folios), and, when they're relevant, the readings proposed by editors from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.""";

Because the level of deterioration is set arbitrarily, the test has a subjective aspect that makes results open to dispute.

In cool storage, materials can be paged directly to a reading room without acclimatization.  In cold storage, materials may be kept at freezing temperatures and must go through a staging process to bring them up to temperature where they can be used safely.",
        "In general, cold begins at 65°F (18°C) and continues down to 0°F (-18°C).  Sometimes cool storage (65°F to 40°F, 18°C to 5°C) is distinguished from cold storage (40°F to 0°F, 18°C to 5°C).  Because deterioration caused by chemical reactions is directly related to temperature (see Arrhenius function), keeping materials at a lower temperature can significantly slow the effects of aging. A number of standards include precise definitions of cold, based on the materials to be stored.  See, for example, Storage: Paper Records (NISO TR01), Storage: Photographic Film (ANSI/PIMA IT9.11/ISO 5466), and Storage: Optical Disc Media (ANSI/PIMA IT9.25). " .

This model portrays the life of a record as going through various stages or periods, much like a living organism. In stage one, the record is created, presumably for a legitimate reason and according to certain standards. In the second stage, the record goes through an active period when it has maximum primary value and is used or referred to frequently by the creating office and others involved in decision making. During this time the record is stored on-site in the active or current files of the creating office. At the end of stage two the record may be reviewed and determined to have no further value, at which point it is destroyed, or the record can enter stage three, where it is relegated to a semi-active status, which means it still has value, but is not needed for day-to-day decision making. Because the record need not be consulted regularly, it is often stored in a off-site storage center. At the end of stage three, another review occurs, at which point a determination is made to destroy or send the record to stage four, which is reserved for inactive records with long-term, indefinite, archival value. This small percentage of records (normally estimated at approximately five per cent of the total documentation) is sent to an archival repository, where specific activities are undertaken to preserve and describe the records.

¶ The life cycle model not only describes what will happen to a record, it also defines who will manage the record during each stage. During the creation and active periods, the record creators have primary responsibility for managing the record, although records managers may well be involved to various degrees. In the semi-active stage, it is the records manager who takes center stage and assumes major responsibility for managing the records. Finally, in the inactive stage, the archivist takes the lead in preserving, describing, and providing access to the archival record.""";

In the translation of diplomatic concepts into the modern, paper-based, recordkeeping environments, the medium has continued to be treated as a part of the record itself, mainly because the medium and the message are inextricably linked. ¶  The question was whether, in an electronic recordkeeping environment, the medium should continue to be treated as an essential part of the record itself given that 1) the medium and the message are no longer inextricably linked; 2) what is inscribed on or affixed to the medium is not a record as such (or words, or pictures), but a bitstream; and 3) the choice of a medium by those creating or maintaining the record is often arbitrary and carries no particular significance.";

Moral rights protect the personal and reputational, rather than purely monetary, value of a work to its creator. . . . 

¶  In the U.S., moral rights are primarily protected by VARA. Before VARA was passed, courts and commentators struggled to find moral rights in the "derivative work" provision of the Copyright Act, the laws of defamation, the rights of privacy and publicity, the doctrine of misappropriation, and especially the Lanham Act, which deals with trademarks and unfair competition.  Authors may seek moral rights protection from state moral rights laws and art preservation statutes in California and New York, whose provisions resemble those of VARA.

In the case of a reformatted photograph, some information embedded in the material nature of the original will be lost in the reproduction.  For example, a modern copy print of a 19th-century cabinet print will almost certainly use a different process, may not be the same size, and may not reproduce the back; the process, size, and date, which can help date the original, are missing from the reformatted copy." .

A shortcoming of the original DSS systems was that they were developed by different business units, resulting in disagreement between users on data definitions. Thus, no organisational view on data existed. These different data definitions also lead to inconsistent reports that cannot be used by management for decision making. In turn, the inconsistent reports cause users not to trust reports and organisational data. These problems were aggravated by the fact that data that went into the DSS systems were sometimes 'dirty' or inaccurate as there was no 'scrubbing' or cleansing process to ensure accurate data, presented in a uniform format. Lastly, data were shared reluctantly in business-unit-centric systems, and the data were not integrated, requiring complicated bridges to share data [citing Moss & Adelman 1999a].

The name both points to the future as we move into the 21st century and suggests the international character of the format, which is appropriate and important given its expanding worldwide use. 

¶  MARC 21 is not a new format. From 1994-1997 the USMARC and CAN/MARC user communities worked to eliminate all remaining differences in their two already-similar formats. Compatibility had been a feature of the development processes for both formats for many years. In 1997 and early 1998, updates to the formats were issued that made the format specifications identical. MARC 21, a continuation of both USMARC and CAN/MARC, publishes the formats in one edition under a new name.""";

The British practice, we believed, if applied in the National Archives, could lead sometimes to groupings too large for administrative convenience. We thought it better to divide the records of such large 'agencies' as departments into a number of separate record groups, usually reflecting the bureaus within departments and of 'convenient size' for administration.

¶  On the Continent the French term 'fonds d'archives' – meaning the body or stock of records of a record-creating unit – was widely known in archival literature and accepted as the basis of arrangement work. . . .  As applied in practice, the records of any subordinate office that kept records, no matter how small the office, were considered a 'fonds.'  This was going to the other extreme of 'convenient size,' and the 'record group' principle as defined in the National Archives united the records of subordinate offices under their superior offices, usually up to the bureau level.

The archivist recognises the fonds as the set of items that have been created and accumulated by an identifiable individual body (or bodies). However, it should be emphasised that both these classes of aggregates (the fonds and the artificial collection) are 'collections' in the more general sense in which the term is used here.

A key difference is that, in the absence of a title page to serve as the chief source of information, archival description requires a significant amount of the content of the description to be supplied from the context of the materials being described, whereas the content of bibliographic description is transcribed directly from the material being described.  Also, archival descriptions are intended to be updated if materials are added to the collection." .

Similarly, some electronic document content is not fixed, but may change over time; for example, a word processing document that pulls data from a constantly changing database.

However, the processes that interested parties follow to establish standards can differ dramatically. Standards can either be de facto (occurring as a result of natural market movement and adoption) or prescribed (established by formal agreement). De facto standards often result when one vendor dominates a market, while prescribed standards develop in competitive environments where market participants realize that agreement upon a standard will benefit all of the participants. De facto standards incite little argument, because the market as a whole decides them.

    skos:scopeNote "'Manuscript repository' is sometimes used instead of archives3 to distinguish an organization that collects personal papers from an agency that collects the records of its parent organization.",
        "In the vernacular, 'archives' is often used to refer to any collection of documents that are old or of historical interest, regardless of how they are organized; in this sense, the term is synonymous with permanent records.  That use is reflected by archives6, as used within the e-prints community and periodicals such as The Archives of Internal Medicine.  Within the professional literature, archives are characterized by an organic nature, growing out of the process of creating and receiving records in the course of the routine activities of the creator (its provenance).  In this sense, archivists have differentiated archives from artificial collections.",
        "Many archivists, especially those in the United States who are influenced by the thinking of Theodore Schellenberg, follow an inclusive definition of archives, which encompasses a wide variety of documents and records.  Schellenberg also distinguished between the primary and secondary value of the materials; only materials with secondary value, value beyond their original purpose, could be considered archival. For Schellenberg, archivists appraise records for transfer to the archives on the basis of their secondary, research, evidential, or informational value. ",
        "Other archivists follow the writing of Hilary Jenkinson, who argues that archives are 'documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference.'  For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation.  Because Jenkinson emphasized that records are evidence of transactions, he did not recognize any collections of historical documents as archives, although he noted that collections of personal papers were of value to historians because they complemented archives. ",
        "Some United States archivists deprecate the use of the form 'archive' (without the final s) as a noun, but that form is common in other English-speaking countries.  However, the noun 'archive' is commonly used to describe collections of backup data in information technology literature." .

Primary values are those reflecting the basic business purpose(s) served by the records, the reason they were created. Secondary values reflect other uses to which the information may be put during the course of their life cycle, uses that may justify continuing retention after the expiration of primary values. Administrative or operational values are usually identified as primary values. Research or historical values are generally designated as secondary values. Legal value can be either a primary or a secondary value, depending on the purpose and function of a record. A records series can (and usually does) possess several of these values simultaneously, and they may change during a record's life cycle.";

The silver halide is reduced to metallic silver in black-and-white photographs and is used to form a dye in color photographs.  In the 19th century, collodion was commonly used as a binder for negatives, prints, ambrotypes, and tintypes, and albumen was the most common binder for prints.  Most modern photographic processes use gelatin to bind the silver halide to a film, paper, or glass support.  ",

However, print3 is commonly used to describe images originally made with a camera but reproduced using a photomechanical process, such as a halftone or a Woodburytype.

    skos:scopeNote " Similarly, publication has been used as a means to preserve records by distributing copies among many owners and many locations to increase the odds that at least one copy will survive if others are lost or damaged. - Copy1, 2 and duplicate1 are often synonyms.  However, 'copy' connotes a something reproduced from an original; for example, a Xerox copy.  'Duplicate' connotes a version that may be considered an original; for example, duplicate prints made from the same negative. - A copy1, 2 made with the intent to deceive is often described as a forgery or a counterfeit.  A copy or similar work made by the creator of the original is often described as a replica or version.",
        "A copy1 can vary significantly in its fidelity to the original.   In some instances, it may be sufficient for a copy to capture only the intellectual content of the record without regard to formatting (see fair copy).  Or it may be an exacting facsimile of the original.  Because there is always some loss of quality when making a copy, originals have greater authenticity than copies. Hence originals are preferred over copies for evidence (see best evidence).  The value of the information is not increased by repetition.  However, the presence of many copies of a record may serve as a check on the trustworthiness of a record; the presence of multiple, identical copies suggests that the record has not be altered.  " .

    skos:scopeNote "'Record' connotes documents, rather than artifacts or published materials, although collections of records may contain artifacts and books.  To the extent that records are defined in terms of their function rather than their characteristics, the definition is stretched to include many materials not normally understood to be a record; an artifact may function as a record, even though it falls outside the vernacular understanding of the definition.",
        "'Record' is frequently used synonymously with 'document'.  To the extent the vernacular uses 'record' to refer to any document, without specification, the terms are synonymous.  However, the concept of record is independent of format, and it includes things that are clearly not documents.  For example, an artifact may serve as a record if it is preserved to bolster human memory or to demonstrate accountability.",
        "A document's structure is contained within boundaries, which define the record as a unit and give it identity by distinguishing it from other information.  A record may consist of many physically or logically discrete parts that function together as unit, such as several pages or data values from many tables.  However, those parts must be bound together in some fashion.",
        "A record is often unique, whereas a publication is always created in multiple copies.  However, a record may be a single copy of many that has been selected for preservation or special treatment (a record copy).  For example, a publisher may keep one copy of each publication as a record. ",
        "A record1, 2, 3 has fixed content, structure, and context.  ",
        "Content is the text, data, symbols, numerals, images, sound, graphics, and other information that make up the substance of the record.  A record's ability to fix information so that it can be repeated, recited, or recalled at a later date functions as an extension of memory and is at the heart of the concept of record.  A record may be created specifically to preserve information over time or to prevent future misinterpretation of that information, although a record cannot be presumed to be reliable without authentication.  However, any item - no matter how ephemeral it was intended to be - may serve as a record if it is later used as evidence of the thing to which it refers.",
        "Context is the organizational, functional, and operational circumstances surrounding a record's creation, receipt, storage, or use.  Context includes a record's date and place of creation, compilation, or issue, and its relationship to other records.",
        "Fixity is the quality of content being stable and resisting change.  To preserve memory effectively, record content must be consistent over time.  Records made on mutable media, such as electronic records, must be managed so that it is possible to demonstrate that the content has not degraded or been altered.  A record may be fixed without being static.  A computer program may allow a user to analyze and view data many different ways.  A database itself may be considered a record if the underlying data is fixed and the same analysis and resulting view remain the same over time.",
        "Record2, 3 is sometimes used to mean the record copy or official record, the complete, final, and authoritative version that is preserved.  This sense of record is distinguished from nonrecord or document3, which includes copies of the official record or materials that are not scheduled and can be disposed of without authorization.",
        "Records are not synonymous with archives. While an archives collects records, not all records merit ongoing preservation.",
        "Records are sometimes distinguished from papers, with 'records' referring to items that were generated as the result of routine activities or a transactions, especially those of an organization.  'Papers' refer to documents created on a more or less ad hoc basis, especially those of an individual.",
        "Records may be in any format, including text, images, or sound.  However, the concept of record is ultimately independent of any specific carrier or format.  Paper records may be microfilmed, and electronic records may be transferred from memory to disk to paper.  ",
        "See narrower terms for more specific definitions of different types of records. The use of the general term 'record' when referring to a particular type of record inevitably leads to confusion because attributes of the particular type are not conveyed by the general term. In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations.  The general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301, cited below), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC § 552(a), cited below).   See also business record, which is defined in the Rules of Federal Evidence. ",
        "Structure refers to a record's physical characteristics and internal organization of the contents.  Record structure is the form that makes the content tangible and intelligible.  Physical characteristics include components and methods of assembly, such as paper, ink, seals, and font families, or character sets, encoding, and file formats.  Structure also includes the intellectual organization of a document.  A record's structure may be very simple, such as plain text on a page; it may be organized into an outline or sections with headings; or it may be highly complex, including a preamble, the body, and the signatures of witnesses." .
