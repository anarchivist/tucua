    skos:prefLabel "color balance";
    skos:scopeNote "Images with an inaccurate color balance1 have a general cast, often subtle but sometimes quiet pronounced.  For example, as color photographs age, their color balance may shift from neutral to a distinct hue due to the relative instability of the dyes.  In some processes, yellow dyes often fade more rapidly than other dyes, and images may take on a magenta cast over time.  In other cases, a layer becomes uniformly stained, giving the image a yellow cast. - Color balance2 may be distorted by using materials designed for use with the wrong type of light source.  For example, color film intended to be used outdoors will appear yellow if exposed under incandescent lights or green if exposed under fluorescent light." .

Printed images have a smaller range of tones than images viewed by transmitted light.  Similarly, different computer monitors may display the same file with very different colors due to variations in hardware design and age.  Color management systems attempt to minimize differences by calibrating equipment and processes to standard colors to control the appearance of color." .

The photographer could monitor the printing progress in reduced light by pulling the paper away from the negative; if more exposure was needed, the sandwich was returned to sunlight to continue printing.  After exposure, the prints were fixed to halt further development.  Printing-out papers produce images that are a purplish brown and were usually toned to a purple black. Unfixed printing-out paper, often used for portrait proof prints, are often rust-colored and show signs of silver mirroring.

They continue to be used for applications that require many individuals to work simultaneously with a large amount of shared data, such as a large corporate accounting system.  Because 'mainframe' describes older systems, the term 'supercomputer' was introduced to describe a new class of very powerful computers, especially very fast or massively-parallel architectures.  'Minicomputer' was used to describe smaller systems, especially those with all components contained in a single cabinet. The term has generally fallen out of use.  'Microcomputer' and 'personal computer' (PC) are near synonyms that refer to small systems that rely on a single-chip central processing unit (CPU).   'Workstation' connotes a very powerful microcomputer designed for use by an individual for processor-intensive applications but is often used to mean any personal computer.  Given the increase of speed and capacity of hardware, the distinctions between these categories of computers are significantly blurred by the fact that many modern laptops are more powerful than early mainframes.

Because the level of deterioration is set arbitrarily, the test has a subjective aspect that makes results open to dispute.

For example, it may be permissible to build components that connect to an open hardware system, but not to reproduce the system itself." .

        "In the vernacular, 'archives' is often used to refer to any collection of documents that are old or of historical interest, regardless of how they are organized; in this sense, the term is synonymous with permanent records.  That use is reflected by archives6, as used within the e-prints community and periodicals such as The Archives of Internal Medicine.  Within the professional literature, archives are characterized by an organic nature, growing out of the process of creating and receiving records in the course of the routine activities of the creator (its provenance).  In this sense, archivists have differentiated archives from artificial collections.",
        "Many archivists, especially those in the United States who are influenced by the thinking of Theodore Schellenberg, follow an inclusive definition of archives, which encompasses a wide variety of documents and records.  Schellenberg also distinguished between the primary and secondary value of the materials; only materials with secondary value, value beyond their original purpose, could be considered archival. For Schellenberg, archivists appraise records for transfer to the archives on the basis of their secondary, research, evidential, or informational value. ",
        "Other archivists follow the writing of Hilary Jenkinson, who argues that archives are 'documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference.'  For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation.  Because Jenkinson emphasized that records are evidence of transactions, he did not recognize any collections of historical documents as archives, although he noted that collections of personal papers were of value to historians because they complemented archives. ",
        "Some United States archivists deprecate the use of the form 'archive' (without the final s) as a noun, but that form is common in other English-speaking countries.  However, the noun 'archive' is commonly used to describe collections of backup data in information technology literature." .

    skos:scopeNote "Most traditional photographic processes use a silver halide as the light-sensitive material, although light-sensitive salts of copper, iron, and uranium have been used as well.  The silver halide is reduced to metallic silver in black-and-white photographs and is used to form a dye in color photographs.  In the 19th century, collodion was commonly used as a binder for negatives, prints, ambrotypes, and tintypes, and albumen was the most common binder for prints.  Most modern photographic processes use gelatin to bind the silver halide to a film, paper, or glass support.  ",
        "Technically, a photograph1 is distinguished from a print1, in which the image is formed mechanically rather than photochemically.  However, print3 is commonly used to describe images originally made with a camera but reproduced using a photomechanical process, such as a halftone or a Woodburytype.  Such images were, at some point, a photograph before reproduction.  However, digital photographs now capture and record images that are printed using a nonphotographic print process." .

However, 'copy' connotes a something reproduced from an original; for example, a Xerox copy.  'Duplicate' connotes a version that may be considered an original; for example, duplicate prints made from the same negative. - A copy1, 2 made with the intent to deceive is often described as a forgery or a counterfeit.  A copy or similar work made by the creator of the original is often described as a replica or version.",
        "A copy1 can vary significantly in its fidelity to the original.   In some instances, it may be sufficient for a copy to capture only the intellectual content of the record without regard to formatting (see fair copy).  Or it may be an exacting facsimile of the original.  Because there is always some loss of quality when making a copy, originals have greater authenticity than copies. Hence originals are preferred over copies for evidence (see best evidence).  The value of the information is not increased by repetition.  However, the presence of many copies of a record may serve as a check on the trustworthiness of a record; the presence of multiple, identical copies suggests that the record has not be altered.  " .

To the extent that records are defined in terms of their function rather than their characteristics, the definition is stretched to include many materials not normally understood to be a record; an artifact may function as a record, even though it falls outside the vernacular understanding of the definition.",
        "'Record' is frequently used synonymously with 'document'.  To the extent the vernacular uses 'record' to refer to any document, without specification, the terms are synonymous.  However, the concept of record is independent of format, and it includes things that are clearly not documents.  For example, an artifact may serve as a record if it is preserved to bolster human memory or to demonstrate accountability.",

A record may consist of many physically or logically discrete parts that function together as unit, such as several pages or data values from many tables.  However, those parts must be bound together in some fashion.",
        "A record is often unique, whereas a publication is always created in multiple copies.  However, a record may be a single copy of many that has been selected for preservation or special treatment (a record copy).

A record's ability to fix information so that it can be repeated, recited, or recalled at a later date functions as an extension of memory and is at the heart of the concept of record.  A record may be created specifically to preserve information over time or to prevent future misinterpretation of that information, although a record cannot be presumed to be reliable without authentication.  However, any item - no matter how ephemeral it was intended to be - may serve as a record if it is later used as evidence of the thing to which it refers.",
        "Context is the organizational, functional, and operational circumstances surrounding a record's creation, receipt, storage, or use.  Context includes a record's date and place of creation, compilation, or issue, and its relationship to other records.",
        "Fixity is the quality of content being stable and resisting change.  To preserve memory effectively, record content must be consistent over time.  Records made on mutable media, such as electronic records, must be managed so that it is possible to demonstrate that the content has not degraded or been altered.  A record may be fixed without being static.  A computer program may allow a user to analyze and view data many different ways.  A database itself may be considered a record if the underlying data is fixed and the same analysis and resulting view remain the same over time.",
        "Record2, 3 is sometimes used to mean the record copy or official record, the complete, final, and authoritative version that is preserved.  This sense of record is distinguished from nonrecord or document3, which includes copies of the official record or materials that are not scheduled and can be disposed of without authorization.",
        "Records are not synonymous with archives. While an archives collects records, not all records merit ongoing preservation.",
        "Records are sometimes distinguished from papers, with 'records' referring to items that were generated as the result of routine activities or a transactions, especially those of an organization.  'Papers' refer to documents created on a more or less ad hoc basis, especially those of an individual.",
        "Records may be in any format, including text, images, or sound.  However, the concept of record is ultimately independent of any specific carrier or format.  Paper records may be microfilmed, and electronic records may be transferred from memory to disk to paper.  ",
        "See narrower terms for more specific definitions of different types of records. The use of the general term 'record' when referring to a particular type of record inevitably leads to confusion because attributes of the particular type are not conveyed by the general term. In particular, the legal definition of record may change, depending on relevant laws, rules, and regulations.  The general legal definition of public records is established in the Federal Records Act (44 USC 3301, cited below), but 'record' is defined for different purposes in the Privacy Act (5 USC § 552(a), cited below).   See also business record, which is defined in the Rules of Federal Evidence. ",
        "Structure refers to a record's physical characteristics and internal organization of the contents.  Record structure is the form that makes the content tangible and intelligible.  Physical characteristics include components and methods of assembly, such as paper, ink, seals, and font families, or character sets, encoding, and file formats.  Structure also includes the intellectual organization of a document.  A record's structure may be very simple, such as plain text on a page; it may be organized into an outline or sections with headings; or it may be highly complex, including a preamble, the body, and the signatures of witnesses." .
